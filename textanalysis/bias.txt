the supreme court s 5 to 4 decision to strike down a key part of the defense of marriage act was undeniably historic a victory not just for gay rights advocates but for anyone committed to advancing equal rights in america it was also an anomaly for all the celebration wednesday and who will forget the gay men s chorus of washingtonsinging the national anthem outside the court  the underlying theme of the supreme court s term was not the recognition of rights but their dilution time and again in closely divided decisions on issues as disparate as antitrust law privacy and discrimination the court either watered down rights or made it difficult or impossible to enforce them effectively  unless of course you are a white college applicant challenging affirmative action in two cases the justices made it impossible for plaintiffs alleging serious violations of federal law even to have their claims heard in clapper v amnesty international the court denied a constitutional challenge to the fisa amendments act of 2008 which vastly expanded the national security agency s surveillance powers this law authorizes the recently disclosed surveillance programs which involve the interception of international e mails phone conversations and social network communications the act permits surveillance without having to show that the target is suspected of anything thereby jettisoning the bedrock requirement of the fourth amendment the plaintiffs in clapper included lawyers human rights advocates and journalists all of whom communicated frequently with people overseas whom the government was likely to be targeting under the statute and therefore had to take expensive and burdensome measures to preserve the confidentiality of their communications with a majority comprised of chief justice john g roberts jr and justices samuel a alito jr anthony m kennedy antonin scalia and clarence thomas the supreme court ruled that the plaintiffs claims could not be heard because they could not show that they had actually been subjected to the surveillance the catch the surveillance is conducted in secret so no one can be certain that he or she is subject to it in a second case american express co v italian colors restaurant the same five justices ruled that corporations can insulate themselves from liability for violating federal law by inserting clauses in their contracts that prohibit class action arbitration a group of small merchants argued that american express had violated antitrust laws by using its monopoly power to charge credit card fees 30 percent higher than those of its competitors but american express had used the same monopoly power to draft a form contract that directed all legal disputes into arbitration and then forbade arbitration on a class wide basis the merchants argued that because antitrust claims are so expensive to prove they are not worth pursuing on an individual basis and can be vindicated only through collective class wide proceedings the supreme court previously ruled that contracts may require arbitration rather than court litigation only if the arbitration proceeding provides an adequate forum for individuals to vindicate their rights in italian colors the court s majority conceded that requiring individual arbitrations would make it too expensive to challenge american express s conduct but as justice elena kagan paraphrased the majority s response in her dissent too darn bad in three other closely divided decisions the court s conservative justices made equality rights decidedly harder to enforce in shelby county v holder the court invalidated a key provision of the 1965 voting rights act that required select states with a history of discrimination to clear any changes in their voting arrangements with the federal government ahead of time by showing that the changes would not dilute the rights of minority voters this preclearance requirement was the most effective part of the law because it prevented discriminatory actions from taking effect in the first place rather than requiring victims to later sue in court where challenges are often so expensive and time consuming that they cannot adequately address many discriminatory voting practices the court previously upheld the preclearance requirement four times but on tuesday the conservative majority broke with years of precedent and concluded that the rights of states are more important than the equal voting rights of minority citizens in a pair of less noticed decisions released the day before shelby county the court once again by 5 to 4votes issued employer friendly worker hostile interpretations of title vii the section of the civil rights act that prohibits discrimination in employment in both cases the court rejected long standing interpretations of the law by the equal employment opportunity commission in university of texas southwestern medical center v nassar the court imposed a more demanding standard on retaliation claims brought when an employer responds to a discrimination complaint by punishing the employee for raising the issue and in vance v ball state university the court narrowed the definition of supervisors under title vii thereby reducing employers responsibility for racial and sexual harassment in the workplace title vii says employers are more responsible for harassment from supervisors than from co workers and the eeoc had sensibly defined supervisor as a person with the authority to direct another s daily work but the court s conservatives limited supervisors to those who have the formal authority to hire fire and grant or deny promotions a much narrower group the ruling means that victims of harassment by supervisors who lack such formal authority will be significantly less protected the justices also curtailed our rights against the police in maryland v king the court ruled that the state can take dna samples from arrestees without a warrant or any basis for suspicion it reasoned that dna samples like fingerprints are taken for identification purposes not to investigate a crime and so don t have to meet the individualized suspicion standard that applies to investigatory searches but as justice scalia pointed out in a dissent joined by justices kagan sonia sotomayor and ruth bader ginsburg dna samples are not taken to identify arrestees but to investigate whether they are responsible for some other crime the practice of taking dna samples if strictly limited to identifying characteristics and not used to determine an individual s genetic traits may seem reasonable enough as the intrusion is minor but allowing sweeping searches without individualized suspicion runs contrary to the court s long standing fourth amendment rules meanwhile in salinas v texas the court s conservative majority ruled paradoxically that americans right to remain silent won t be protected unless they speak up the court decided that if someone refuses to answer potentially incriminating questions it s perfectly permissible for the state to use that refusal in a criminal trial as long as the questions were asked outside the trial or an interrogation in custody the result is that individuals who believe they have a right to remain silent having been so informed by countless television shows and exercise it will be punished for doing so of course the high court was not uniformly hostile to individual rights in addition to striking down the defense of marriage act s limits on federal marriage benefits it also gave a partial victory to abigail fisher a white applicant who challenged the university of texas s affirmative action plan in that case the court compromised concluding that the lower courts had not subjected the university s plan to sufficient scrutiny and sent the case back for further review but of course that ruling issued in the name of equal protection actually limits efforts to remove barriers for minorities the larger pattern is clear this term the roberts court regularly favored restricting people s rights or more insidiously limiting their ability to enforce those rights almost all these rulings were 5 to 4 decisions most divided along familiar ideological lines the close votes reflect the fact that there were reasonable arguments to be made on both sides but courts play an essential role in safeguarding individual rights and in this term the supreme court repeatedly did the opposite congress could of course fix many of the problems through legislation but leaving the protection of individual rights to a polarized and partisan institution offers cold comfort george takei a defeat for doma and the end of ick david cole the conservative constitution of the united states friend us on facebook and follow us on twitter parts of obamacare are starting to fray even before full implementation the obama administration now says a special system of exchanges designed to make it easier for small businesses to provide insurance will be delayed an entire year to 2015  lots of small businesses struggle with providing insurance for their workers so this was supposed to facilitate it and make it easier for small business to do this said jim capretta of the ethics and public policy center  it was a huge portion of the sale job when they passed the law in 2010 there were many senators and members of congress who were saying i am doing this because it s going to help small businesses the exchanges were designed to give workers a range of choices supported by dollars from their employers but now they will have only one choice until 2015 which could mean they can t shop for insurance that includes their current providers capretta said the administration is way behind schedule since insurance is more expensive for small businesses many of which have no obligation under the law to provide coverage analysts now fear many might just stop trying and let workers go on the soon to be launched state exchanges sara teppema of the society of actuaries which did an exhaustive study of obamacare said that even if it s just a small change of people who are leaving the employment based insurance and coming into the individual insurance market their costs and their numbers will overwhelm those who are currently uninsured meanwhile 79 senators including several liberal lawmakers recently voted to repeal a new tax on medical devices contained in the health care law following a similar vote in the house  the house and the senate agreeing this is a harmonic convergence it doesn t happen said former democratic sen evan bayh  but on this it s happened because the adverse consequences to our economy and the quality of health care are so apparent the two separate votes have not become law but show widespread opposition to the 2 3 percent sales tax on medical devices critics say the law is unfair to the industry since it s a tax on gross sales meaning it adds up to a much bigger percentage of a company s profits but supporters such as paul van de water of the center for american progress oppose any repeal  i think that repealing the device tax would be irresponsible we need the revenue and it s not going to be a job killer he said the theory was that obamacare would insure 30 million more people and that device makers like pharmaceutical companies would get lots of new customers and a steady stream of new revenue to make up for the tax van de water predicted that would still happen  these device manufacturers are for the most part going to be getting a large increase in business thanks to health reform thanks to obamacare he said but the ceo of one company said that s not true for the 7 000 small companies with 400 000 employees who make a wide range of devices christine jacobs of theragenics said we make widgets hips knees stents pacemakers and implants even for prostate cancer those widgets tend to be used by people that are elderly as the body parts wear out we re needed but jacobs notes that most people whose body parts wear out are already on medicare so obamacare does not provide a new revenue stream for her company only financial pain  in the case of a small company that medical device tax is equal to our r and d budget for this year jacobs said bayh said in his own state of indiana one company planned to open up to five facilities over the next five years but had to scrap those plans because of the uncertainty created by this tax jacobs said the huge multinational device makers might be able to handle the burden but not the small companies  it s just such a disproportionate burden for little guys she said  because we re all being told that it s the little companies that create the jobs and that s not message that we re getting the tax will even be applied to sutures used on pets that theragenics developed for the veterinary market she sought fda approval to demonstrate the quality of her products but now she said it s hard for me not to get frosted on this one she explained that whoever wrote the regulations said if you have fda approval you will be taxed president obama has vowed to veto any repeal of the tax but bayh notes that 79 votes in the senate would be more than enough to override any veto u s immigration citizenship and immigration services uscis agents have expressed strong concerns over house judiciary committee chairman rep bob goodlatte r va and other representatives pushing for immigration legislation that would legalize the status of america s at least 11 million illegal immigrants in a public statement that will be released thursday morning but has been provided exclusively to breitbart news ahead of its public release uscis council president kenneth palinkas warned that goodlatte pictured house budget committee chairman rep paul ryan r va house majority leader rep eric cantor r va and rep luis gutierrez d il seem to be following the same pathway that senate gang of eight members did regarding how they are working on immigration legislation  at every step this administration places obstacles and roadblocks in front of our adjudication officers in their attempts to protect our nation s security and the american taxpayer palinkas said  i documented these abuses on more than one occasion with the authors of schumer rubio corker hoeven s 744 only to have them ignored  i worry the house may be following a similar path media reports reveal that chairman bob goodlatte chairman paul ryan congressman luis gutierrez and majority leader eric cantor are working to advance proposals to open citizenship benefits to the majority of those here illegally in combination with proposals to expand visa programs palinkas warned too that any group of step by step house immigration bills may be used as a tool by congressional leaders to get to a conference committee at which point they would be combined with the senate bill and sent to the president for his signature and illegal immigrants would start getting amnesty that is exactly what house minority leader nancy pelosi gang of eight members sens bob menendez d nj and chuck schumer d ny senate majority leader harry reid and some republicans have said they want to do  these plans are being pursued before first reforming the very agency uscis that will be charged with reviewing these tens of millions of green card temporary visa and citizenship applications palinkas said  advancing such measures without first confronting the widespread abuses at uscis would be to invite disaster in his statement palinkas cited a recent msnbc report where gutierrez said he goodlatte and others have worked on a compromise position that msnbc report also noted that goodlatte and other republicans are working with rep henry cuellar d tx another democrat on a plan to get to conference with the senate bill palinkas stated that uscis agents have been like they were from the senate conversations excluded from all discussions among house leaders  why aren t uscis officers being consulted on this compromise offer palinkas asked he further expressed concern over cantor s gop dream act tentatively called the kids act  i am also worried about the arguments being used to support the kids act one piece of the wider citizenship plan being drafted palinkas said  legislators including mr cantor and mr goodlatte have suggested that it is improper to apply immigration law to younger illegal aliens but if it is improper to apply immigration law to one specific group of illegal aliens then why should we expect future illegal aliens in this group to be treated any differently he warned that the kids act may lead down a slippery slope  this seems like an argument for extending birthright citizenship in the future to include the foreign citizens of other countries palinkas asserted  should we just expect that the next secretary at dhs will use the arguments we are hearing in the house to enact the next deferred action program in anticipation of the next legislated amnesty palinkas alleged that under the obama administration uscis has been riddled with nefarious activities  at uscis our institutional mission has been corrupted by politics and i hope these abuses will be examined and fixed before any amnesty proposal is brought forward in the house he said he finished off his statement by listing several immigration issues he hoped house republicans would address but have thus far not been willing to uscis adjudications officers lack the mission support to safely screen and review applicants for immigration benefits this includes the inability to conduct in person interviews the failure of our software system the lack of training and office space and pressure to rubber stamp applications we have become an approval machine failure to protect taxpayers from abuses of the welfare system by those granted immigration benefits administrative orders that require us to grant immigration benefits to those who under law are not properly eligible approval quotas placed on adjudicators that emphasizes clearing applications more than vetting them a management culture that sees illegal aliens and foreign nationals not us citizens and taxpayers as the customer we believe in treating all with respect and always will but our agency s focus must be keeping the country safe and secure on behalf of the american people goodlatte ryan and cantor are not the only republicans still pushing to pass an immigration bill in the house of representatives according to the miami herald rep steve southerland r fl said about immigration we have to address it it s a moral issue in addition according to politico house gop conference chairwoman rep cathy mcmorris rodgers r wa said she thinks immigration should be a top priority for house republicans this year this coming weekend on univision mcmorris rodgers will say that house speaker john boehner over the last few weeks has continued to talk about the importance of the house moving forward on immigration reform i believe that we have a window here between now and the end of the year and that this is a priority mcmorris rodgers is the fourth highest ranking member in the house gop conference the obama administration finalized rules on friday that allow religious affiliated organizations opposing the use of contraception to opt out of a federal mandate requiring that they provide their employees with insurance coverage for birth control the mandates give women at nonprofit religious based organizations like certain hospitals and universities the ability to receive contraception through separate health policies at no charge the rules which were first proposed in february and then open for comment through april have undergone only minor changes chiquita brooks lasure deputy director for policy and regulations at the u s department of health and human services said in a call with reporters that the rules were very similar to the administration s original proposal one of the few noticeable changes is the process by which insurance companies reimburse nonprofit religious organizations such as nonprofit religious hospitals and institutions of higher education that object to contraceptive coverage this process officials from hhs said has provided more distance between the groups that disapprove of contraceptive use and the insurance companies that will be supplying contraceptives to their employees at no cost these slight changes said one hhs representative came after hearing from stakeholders during a public comment period this year in total more than 400 000 comments were sent to the department on the rule objecting organizations and insurers will have until january 1 2014 to comply with the new rules this date was extended from august 1 2013 since obamacare was signed into law in 2010 administration officials have said the administration has attempted to work out how nonprofit organizations can decline to provide contraception coverage to their employees on religious grounds without facing a penalty in a news release about the finalized plans administration officials say these final rules strike the appropriate balance in february the health agency said that while it could not provide a final cost of the plan offering free coverage would lower expenses over the long term partly because of improvements in women s health and fewer childbirths as part of the new rules groups that are insured such as with student health plans at religious colleges would be required to let their insurer know that certain participants would like contraception coverage because the insurer would be covering the costs the changes would allow religious organizations morally opposed to contraception to avoid paying for it although many religious groups applauded the compromise not everyone heralded it as a success the u s conference of catholic bishops said in february that it does not support the obama administration s proposals because they fall short of addressing concerns about religious freedom those calls of disapproval continued after friday s finalization of the contraceptive plans  this latest rule shows the administration is tone deaf to religious freedom said anna higgins director at the family research council  family research council strongly opposes the latest regulation that continues to mandate that life ending drugs and contraceptive services be covered with no copay by health plans of businesses and organizations that have serious moral and religious objections michael hash director of the office of health reform for hhs said the changes that were made took into account suggestions from religious organizations that objected to the rules  i think there is a much brighter line simpler line and we think that responds to the good many comments that we got he said an original mandate on providing contraception was part of the new federal health care law spearheaded by president obama the affordable care act it required that insurers provide at no cost to those insured all forms of contraception approved by the food and drug administration houses of worship were exempt immediately and the administration widened those exemptions last year to include other religiously affiliated organizations like universities and hospitals that still left groups across a wide spectrum of faiths many of which teach that contraception is morally wrong covered by the mandate they denounced it as an infringement on religious liberty a group of 43 catholic organizations challenged the rules in federal court in may the administration had long defended the mandate saying that it did not violate religious liberties the finalized proposal also clarified the definition of a religious employer instead of using a multipart test that required an employer to show religious values as its purpose and to employ persons who share its religious tenets the proposal followed the internal revenue code s definition that includes churches other houses of worship and their affiliated organizations after an uproar among religious institutions that didn t want to pay for contraceptives the obama administration offered several alternatives in march 2012 these plans are a continuation of those efforts the issue of obama s health care act mandating contraception coverage became a hot button political issue during last year s presidential race in august 2012 republican nominee mitt romney released a television ad that attacked the obama administration  president obama used his health care plan to declare war on religion forcing religious institutions to go against their faith the ad said  mitt romney believes that is wrong although the ad did not specifically mention the contraception rule a news release that accompanied the ad justified the war on religion claim using an editorial published in the san antonio express news in february about the health care law s rule on providing contraception the us house of representatives has passed the controversial cyber information sharing and protection act cispa is designed to help combat cyberthreats by making it easier for law enforcers to get at web data this is the second time cispa has been passed by the house senators threw out the first draft saying it did not do enough to protect privacy cispa could fail again in the senate after threats from president obama to veto it over privacy concerns a substantial majority of politicians in the house backed the bill the law is passing through the us legislative system as american federal agencies warn that malicious hackers motivated by money or acting on behalf of foreign governments such as china are one of the biggest threats facing the nation  if you want to take a shot across china s bow this is the answer said mike rogers the republican politician who co wrote cispa and chairs the house intelligence committee cispa has also secured the backing of several technology firms including the ctia wireless industry group as well as the technet computer industry lobby group which has google apple and yahoo as members by contrast the social news website reddit has been vocal in its opposition to the bill in march facebook said it no longer supported cispa the bill could fail again in the senate after the obama administration s threat to use its veto unless changes were made the white house wants amendments so more is done to ensure the minimum amount of data is handed over in investigations the american civil liberties union has also opposed cispa saying the bill was fatally flawed the electronic frontier foundation reporters without borders and the american library association have all voiced similar worries cispa s authors say existing amendments have addressed many of the criticisms and more oversight was being given to data before it was handed over microsoft worked with the national security agency and the fbi to provide the agencies with the encryption workarounds they needed for access to skype video calls outlook web chats and email and information stored on microsoft s cloud based skydrive according to new information shared by nsa leaker edward snowden with the guardian newspaper in the latest round of disclosures about data gathering practices of law enforcement in a program known as prism microsoft has collaborated closely with u s intelligence services to allow users communications to be intercepted including helping the national security agency to circumvent the company s own encryption according to top secret documents obtained by the guardian the newspaper reported thursday the new files provided by edward snowden illustrate the scale of cooperation between silicon valley and the intelligence agencies over the last three years the guardian said microsoft in a statement to nbc news did not address the encryption workaround specifically but said we only ever comply with orders about specific accounts or identifiers and we would not respond to the kind of blanket orders discussed in the press over the past few weeks as the volumes documented in our most recent disclosure clearly illustrate  to be clear microsoft does not provide any government with blanket or direct access to skydrive outlook com skype or any microsoft product the company said when it upgrades or updates products legal obligations may in some circumstances require that we maintain the ability to provide information in response to a law enforcement or national security request there are aspects of this debate that we wish we were able to discuss more freely that s why we ve argued for additional transparency that would help everyone understand and debate these important issues aclu principal technologist chris soghoian told nbc news that the new revelations show that time and time again companies that specifically advertise their services as privacy protecting have been forced to circumvent those privacy protections to enable the government to spy on their customers microsoft isn t the only technology company believed to be cooperating with the government to share data but it is the first to have more details revealed since the initial disclosures last month by snowden at that time he said that microsoft and other technology companies like google facebook apple yahoo and aol were allowing the fbi and nsa to look at americans video audio photos emails and other data files under what is known as the prism program most of the companies including microsoft have since requested government permission to share the information requests that have been made to them according to the information shared by snowden with the guardian microsoft helped the nsa to circumvent its encryption to address concerns that the agency would be able to intercept web chats on the new outlook com portal microsoft completed the transfer of its 300 million hotmail users to outlook com a more modern webmail experience in may the nsa already had pre encryption stage access to email on outlook com including hotmail the guardian said the redmond wash based company also worked with the fbi s data intercept unit to understand potential issues with a feature in outlook com that allows users to create email aliases the newspaper said video chat service skype worked with intelligence agencies last year to allow prism to collect video of conversations as well as audio the guardian said there have been concerns since microsoft bought skype in 2011 about what data the redmond company is sharing with law enforcement last january dozens of organizations including the electronic frontier foundation and digital rights foundation sent an open letter to microsoft asking how when and why the popular video chatting program complies with government requests for information in march microsoft published a transparency report about skype and other of its services  microsoft and skype received a total of 75 378 law enforcement requests the company said in the report  those requests potentially impacted 137 424 accounts while it is not possible to directly compare the number of requests to the number of users affected it is likely that less than 0 02 percent of active users were affected the guardian reports that microsoft also worked with the fbi this year to allow the nsa easier access via prism to its cloud storage service skydrive which now has more than 250 million users worldwide in its statement thursday microsoft said it has clear principles which guide the response across our entire company to government demands for customer information for both law enforcement and national security issues the company takes its commitments to our customers and to compliance with applicable law very seriously so we provide customer data only in response to legal processes microsoft s compliance team examines all demands very closely and we reject them if we believe they aren t valid snowden 30 has worked with the guardian since last month to share information he learned in his time as an nsa contractor about data gathering practices of the nsa one of the country s most secretive agencies he is now believed to be staying in the transit zone of moscow s sheremetyevo airport as he decides where he can go for asylum and where he can avoid being extradited to the united states federal prosecutors have charged snowden with three counts of espionage in choosing john brennan to be the next director of the central intelligence agency president barack obama is turning to a trusted deputy and architect of the administration s unconventional covert war against radical adversaries a 25 year cia veteran who joined mr obama s 2008 presidential campaign after leaving the agency mr brennan straddled the counterterrorism policies of two administrations drawing on his experience serving under president george w bush when he became mr obama s counterterrorism chief indeed i m sure jeffrey goldberg got it right whatever the reason the president leaked his unhappiness with bibi to goldberg just a few days before the israeli election whether in an effort to influence the vote against bibi serve payback to bibi for a perceived preference for romney or because the president could simply no longer suppress his dissatisfaction it must indeed be unnerving to be the most powerful man on earth and have the elected leader of a tiny middle eastern country defy you especially when that country in your opinion owes you so much you are their only reliable friend who watches helplessly as that little nation continues to isolate itself through its self destructive policies according to goldberg obama has become inured to what he sees as self defeating policies of his israeli counterpart obama said privately and repeatedly israel doesn t know what its own best interests are netanyahu is moving his country down a path toward near total isolation if only israel would recognize the president s genius if only it would stop building in jerusalem and e1 and allow the president to sprinkle his magic peace dust then hamas would beat its rockets into ploughshares and hezbollah would turn its bombs into pruning hooks but no ungrateful to the last bibi insists on disobeying the president and claiming all of jerusalem as israel s undivided capitol no doubt the president is likewise mystified at the israeli people as well how could the polls show that they will this week re elect the intransigent prime minister who is doing so much to harm their country the most powerful man on earth is reduced to watching from the sidelines and complaining to journalists that he knows how to protect israel far better than the israelis themselves and yet perhaps the israelis have finally figured out that they are a sovereign people whom while immensely grateful to america for its friendship and support are still best qualified to judge their security needs better than anyone else perhaps they have come to understand that another democratic president named bill clinton whom noone would argue has a sincere love of the jewish people and a jewish son in law still pushed israel into the oslo agreements that left a thousand israeli civilians blown to bits perhaps they have come to understand that if chuck hagel president obama s nominee for secretary of defense was correct that as a legislator from nebraska he was not an israeli senator i m a united states senator then the prime minister of israel is the likewise the leader of the jewish state who must put the security of the israeli people even before a nod of approval from the president of the united states over the past four years bibi has grown into one of israel s greatest ever leaders the country is booming economically and in terms of security cranes dot the skyline of expanding israeli cities terror incidents are negligible compared to the clinton era and unlike the anemic american economy israel is humming along at about four percent annual growth and if president obama is right that in spite of this prosperity israel is isolated in world opinion then it is arguably no more so than it has been in the past and besides what is better a popular israel riddled with dead jews or an unpopular israel filled with living ones but what president obama does not understand about netanyahu is that the inflexibility he accuses him of is born not of a narrow minded obstinacy but rather of a confident jewish pride and deep seated conviction that has been bibi s lifelong hallmark in my desire in 1990 to launch a robust response to anti israel speeches at the oxford union i booked netanyahu to lecture at the university bibi just 41 years old had already electrified the world as israel s most capable defender at the un bibi agreed to come with a single stipulation if i m already making the trip then work me like a horse we picked him up in a special branch police car and as we drove through the grandeur of oxford s ancient center he commented on the majesty of british academia and its incongruence with some of the petty anti israel sentiment that is often expressed within its halls arriving at st antony s college for a private forum with oxford middle east experts bibi put one foot on a chair and for the next 90 minutes held forth on the justice of israel s cause surrounded as it was by nation s sworn to its destruction as he finished the attacks came in fast and furious in what had to be one of the most hostile audiences he ever addressed he did not blink he did not flinch he did not bend when the last question ended he turned to me to ask what next after two more speeches we took him to my home where we had arranged a dinner with rhodes scholars many of them jewish most critical of israeli policy this time bibi was softer in presentation but just as firm in conviction israel was a righteous nation focused on maintaining democracy and human rights while facing existential threats on nearly every border he spoke to the students of their responsibility to be proud defenders of their people and never bend in the face of opposition the climax of the day was a lecture at the union itself palestinian and jewish protesters rallied outside in their hundreds with the rallying cry net an ya hu you should know we support the p l o bibi left his security bubble and walked over to the protesters  come inside and listen then you can protest i ll answer every question you ask many left their barricades and joined the large crowd inside what followed was one of the great speeches i have heard a mesmerizing presentation of the need for democracy across the middle east and the liberalization of arab governments that deny their citizens their god given human rights at its high point bibi said many of us in israel have buried children and lost brothers in fulfillment of a simple dream for jews to finally live and prosper in a country of their own in peace he did not have to mention whom he was referring to as even his detractors knew of entebbe and the hero brother he had lost again he was bombarded with hostile questions he responded patiently but forcefully when he finished he was given a standing ovation by most of the students in the hall it was a night few of us would forget no israeli prime minister has ever been as american as bibi and yet no prime minister has so successfully resisted the pressure from the leader of a country he loves so much for a country he loves even more and the israeli people in supporting bibi regardless of the absence of a stamp of approval from president obama are finally realizing that israel cannot ultimately be protected from washington but jerusalem especially when the current american administration is not in step with the strong sympathy of the american people for a tiny and just nation fighting for its life shmuley boteach america s rabbi whom the washington post calls the most famous rabbi in america has just published his newest best seller the fed up man of faith challenging god

you re having issues with commenting we re sorry we seem to have lost this page but we don t want to lose you you don t come to be the no 2 senate democrat without proving you can help your friends along the way that s why the motivation behind dick durbin s ongoing campaign against a prominent free market group deserves attention this week the illinois democrat held his long awaited hearing on state stand your ground laws with the putative goal of blaming them for gun violence and racial discrimination trayvon martin s mother testified at the packed hearing and sen durbin proclaimed against the laws when the trifecta of scandals first broke over the white house a few weeks ago the media who were literally blocking the truth from getting out about the irs and benghazi were so caught off guard that for a couple of weeks they accidentally acted like real media and just reported the facts over memorial day weekend that all changed it is fairly obvious that the media used the three day weekend to gather themselves talk to the white house and coordinate talking points with one another the result of this coordination has been apparent in the words overreach mccarthyism disarray and no gop agenda all being uttered simultaneously across media platforms that are supposed to compete not coordinate with one another the idea is for the media to revert to form rather than seek the truth the media will go back to attacking those seeking the truth obama s approval rating is going down his left wing agenda and legacy are in jeopardy and the bleeding must be stopped another piece of coordination between media and democrats reared its ugly head today in the most expected of places politico no one takes more glee in savaging private citizens who dare not support obama than obama s bullying thugs at politico during tuesday s testimony congressional democrats attacked the private citizens brought before them to tell their individual horror stories the witnesses were tea party groups and other conservative groups put through months of paralyzing harassment by an irs that had intentionally singled them out based on their political beliefs democrats however did not care about the fact that these groups had been targeted and they kept insinuating that these groups deserved the irs scrutiny due to their political activity well that is not the point and everyone knows it had the irs put the same number of left leaning groups through the same hyper scrutiny as they did right leaning groups none of this would be happening there would be no scandal but the idea here is to change the subject from the fact that the irs singled out obama s political foes for paralyzing scrutiny in the run up to obama s re election campaign to the supposed abuse of a tax exempt status by conservative political groups the thinking goes that if democrats can make the tea party look like tax cheats it will take the heat off of obama and further damage his opponents well right on cue politico arrives this morning like the cavalry with an appallingly dishonest but expected piece of reporting that falls right in line with what congressional democrats did yesterday it is as pure a piece of coordination and left wing propaganda as you will ever read and this is the only kind of investigative reporting politico ever does imagine if politico poured these same resources into investigating the irs s connections to the white house or the shaping of the irs talking points by the state department but today s politico piece is all about changing the subject all it looks at is the political activity of yesterday s tea party witnesses in order to make a case that they deserved scrutiny from the irs the politico piece however intentionally ignores the fact that this is not the point of the scandal the point is that these groups were singled out for harassment by their own government the politico piece intentionally ignores and chooses not to report on all the political activity of tax exempt left leaning groups like obama s organizing for america groups approved by the irs that are every bit as political as those on the right who were paralyzed by lengthy and intrusive questionnaires and threats of perjury those who had their information leaked to the media working directly with the democrats politico is now putting in overtime to desperately steer subject away from and distract from partisan horrors committed by the irs the actual crime is no longer the story according to politico no the story is that the victims had it coming before an adoring crowd of religious conservatives sarah palin mocked recent scandals swirling around the obama administration performing her own version of a saturday night live parody  they have this skit where they do this fake newscast and they read this completely absurd news report and finish it with an incredulous really palin told the audience saturday afternoon at the jw marriott in downtown washington  as in our government spied on every single one of your phone calls but it couldn t find two pot smoking deadbeat bostonians with a hotline to terrorist central in chechnya  the irs says it can t figure out how it managed to spend more than 4 million on training conferences because it didn t keep its receipts she said to uproarious laughter  really we re gathering in a town that is awash in scandal said palin the closing speaker at the annual meeting of the faith and freedom coalition  in other words just another saturday afternoon in washington d c the faith and freedom coalition a 501 c 4 organization was founded in 2009 by ralph reed as a way to join together tea party activists and religious conservatives the theme of the three day conference was road to majority and featured a lineup of conservatives from sen marco rubio to grover g norquist to herman cain palin criticized obama s leadership including his foreign policy efforts and argued that the united states should not intervene in syria but instead let allah sort it out where is our commander in chief she said  we re talking now more new interventions i say until we know what we re doing until we have a commander in chief who knows what he s doing well let these radical islamic countries who aren t even respecting basic human rights where both sides are slaughtering each other as they scream over an arbitrary red line allah akbar i say until we have someone who knows what they re doing i say let allah sort it out the line drew laughter from the audience speaker after speaker offered strategies for conservatives to win control of congress and the white house cain the former chief executive of godfather s pizza who cut short his bid for the gop nomination after he was accused of sexual harassment and having an extramarital affair said he had a formula for winning  eta said cain with the flair of a man who became known for his 9 9 9 tax plan he said the phrase was shorthand for enthusiasm targeted races and activists conservatives need to target races and cultivate fresh faces he said  we have got to stop sending nearly 90 percent of the people in d c back to d c said cain who has a radio talk show  we should expand what we ve already been doing create a groundswell of activists and citizens and patriots texas gov rick perry another former republican presidential candidate told the conference that conservative activists have a long way to go to make an impact on national politics and advised them to shift their tone  we stand for the principles that made america great perry said  we should exude those principals with joy smile when you disagree with a liberal as ronald reagan said liberals know so much that isn t so our conservative convictions will win this country back if our tone shows we re comfortable with our own ideals among the speakers who brought attendees to their feet was e w jackson a chesapeake minister who was a virtual political unknown until a month ago when he clinched the gop nomination for lieutenant governor of virginia since then liberals and some national gop figures have bemoaned controversial jackson comments including his belief that planned parenthood has harmed black americans more than the ku klux klan and that gays and lesbians are very sick people jackson offered a fiery 10 minutes on how the left is assaulting religious freedom and trying to redefine liberty  freedom doesn t mean do whatever you want it s the pursuit of character integrity decency honor now we re being told freedom is license he said palin the 2008 republican vice presidential candidate and former alaska governor had some harsh words for some gop leaders who have blamed far right candidates for the party s recent national losses  to our republican leadership you don t marginalize discredit and dismiss everyday hardworking americans she said she urged tea party activists to keep at it  start on a local level affecting change as you work on the higher levels of politicos she said  or do both just do both americans need to rededicate the country to our one true heavenly father said palin who is writing a book about faith and christmas and returns to the airwaves monday as part of the fox friends program on fox news  if we rededicate our land to our lord things will turn around now the immigration debate is really getting juicy rep steve king an iowa republican has always been a bit of a melon head but he outdid himself in an interview that came to light this week in which he described dreamers people brought to this country illegally as children as misshapen drug mules  for every one who s a valedictorian there s another 100 out there that they weigh 130 pounds and they ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert the honorable gentleman said cantaloupe calves this was a rotten tomato tossed at latinos who were already suspicious of republicans before the insult was added to the injury of house conservatives such as king blocking action on bipartisan immigration legislation king kept on throwing  it s not something that i m making up he told radio iowa on tuesday evening hours after a democrat who had discovered the recent interview with newsmax read the offending comments aloud at a congressional hearing  we have people that are mules that are drug mules that are hauling drugs across the border and you can tell by their physical characteristics what they ve been doing for months going through the desert with 75 pounds of drugs on their back and if those who advocate for the dream act if they choose to characterize this about valedictorians i gave them a different image king certainly gave his colleagues a different image that of a republican party driven into extinction in coming decades because it antagonized what is becoming the most important voting bloc even his usual conservative partners moved to isolate him  irresponsible and reprehensible rep raul labrador idaho said at a luncheon gathering with reporters called conversations with conservatives  i think what he said was out of touch with the gop conference in lieu of a defense of king labrador scolded the assembled journalists for their reporting on king s out of his gourd remark but not the favorable things other republicans say about immigrants  shame on you shame on the media he lectured  make sure that your article talks about what every republican said labrador proposed not what one outlier said this is similar to scolding the media for focusing on the one plane that crashes and not giving equal attention to all the planes that land safely more to the point it s not at all clear that king is such an outlier certainly his zany remarks are low hanging fruit for journalists just last week he got into a heated exchange with a univision host who asked about a speech in which king likened immigrants to a litter of puppies  you want a good bird dog he asked  pick the one that s the friskiest    you get the pick of the litter and you got yourself a pretty good bird dog well we ve got the pick of every donor civilization on the planet but if republicans think king is a fruitcake they don t show it on the house floor where last month they approved along party lines an amendment king offered that would force the obama administration to resume deportation of the dreamers who immigrated as children  if this position holds no amnesty will reach the president s desk the congressman said in a celebratory statement after the vote and king s position is holding boehner responding to house conservatives is refusing to take up the senate legislation because he has chosen a strategy of passing legislation through the house without democratic votes the speaker can t afford to lose more than a handful of republicans this empowers outliers such as king  the reason we re in a bottleneck here in congress is because of a few like him rep rubén hinojosa d tex  chairman of the congressional hispanic caucus told me wednesday afternoon at a caucus event outside the capitol  evidently there s enough to be able to force the speaker of the house to stall and not be able to do this immigration reform republicans say their objections to the immigration bill have nothing to do with racial or ethnic discrimination and that s surely the case for most of them but king makes it easy for democrats to tar the republicans with sinister motives rep ben luján d n m one of several speakers denouncing king on the house floor wednesday said his slur shows why the american people continue to see house republicans as out of touch that s not quite fair but when one of their own is talking about cantaloupe calves republicans aren t in a strong position to complain about cherry picking read more from dana milbank s archive follow him on twitter or subscribe to his updates on facebook cristian a 32 year old blacksmith from uruguay grows five cannabis plants with care and dedication in the back yard of his workshop on the outskirts of montevideo  i have been smoking three or four joints a day since i was 13 he says  but last year i decided to grow my own cannabis because the quality of the marijuana at the boca hotspots where illegal drugs are sold is too low or it comes mixed with hard and dangerous drugs like cocaine paste he says every morning cristian checks his plants have the appropriate amount of light fertiliser and insecticide but above all he always makes sure they are well hidden from the police and out of the neighbours sight for decades smoking cannabis has been legal in this south american country seeing a group of youngsters sharing a joint in the park has become a familiar scene but growing and buying the drug have remained illegal but that is about to change uruguay is set to become the first nation in the world to regulate the production sale and consumption of cannabis after a new law was passed by the country s senate on tuesday once the president signs the bill the state will control the production and sale of cannabis for cristian this will mean that instead of hiding his plants from the police the authorities will supervise them to make sure he complies with the new rules a central body the national institute for cannabis regulation will provide those who want to grow marijuana with seeds and ensure that their crop does not exceed the legal limit of 480g 1lb 1oz per year  i think it was about time that cannabis became legal police should worry about fighting crime and drug trafficking not me he says the man behind the law is 78 year old former guerrilla fighter turned president jose mujica the president says he opposes drug consumption but wants to take the multi million dollar cannabis business away from the drug cartels under the new law buyers will have to officially register something only residents can do not tourists there will also be a strict 40g month limit on those who grow the drug or buy it at licensed pharmacies  what i am doing is offering consumers a legal amount president mujica explains the bill goes several steps further than existing legislation in the netherlands where growing cannabis is not legal although the authorities turn a blind eye to those who grow some plants at home it bears some similarities to drug laws in the us states of colorado and washington where the sale of cannabis for medicinal or recreational use was made legal in 2012 but uruguay is the first nation state to regulate the production distribution and sale of the drug the country which has a population of fewer than 3 5 million people has so far been spared much of the drug related violence that other latin american countries have suffered from but officials say it is time to tackle drug gangs before they get too strong  last year 82 people were killed in drug related violence in uruguay we are starting to see episodes of criminal score settling groups of hitmen but we are not aware of anybody who died because of marijuana consumption explains the head of the national drug agency julio calzada other latin american countries are watching uruguay s experiment with interest guatemalan president otto perez molina whose country is suffering from a wave of violence blamed on drug cartels has described his uruguayan counterpart as a visionary mexican foreign minister jose antonio meade recently warned that unilateral policies would not solve the problem and asked for a global discussion about drug policy uruguay s neighbour brazil sent a delegation to montevideo earlier this year to express its concern about the potential impact of the new law but mr calzada insists uruguay s neighbours will benefit as well as its own citizens  our commitment to other countries is that our legal marijuana will not end up smuggled into their territory this will not happen he assures foreign sceptics but the law is also facing criticism at home according to recent polls 60 of uruguayans oppose the bill congresswoman veronica alonso of the national party is one of them  this law does not solve the real problems if the government really wants to fight insecurity it should tackle the places where illegal drugs are sold she told the bbc  if it is a matter of public health then it should work to prevent the consumption of other drugs like tobacco or alcohol she argues ms alonso fears that the law will encourage drug consumption especially among young uruguayans  there will be a higher availability of marijuana and at the same time the perception of marijuana as a dangerous drug will be lower therefore consumption will grow she says  this is going to cause us a lot of problems especially from a social and medical point of view and the state is not ready to face them whether good or bad the effects of the government s pioneering move are certain to be scrutinised and analysed by both opponents and supporters of cannabis legalisation not just in uruguay but across the world during a senate judiciary committee hearing on friday sen chuck schumer d ny a member of the bipartisan gang of eight urged his senate colleagues and members of the media at the immigration bill hearing to not tie the bill to the boston terror attack bombings after he made the request he proceeded to do exactly what he asked others to not do  before i get to the bill i d like to ask that all of us not jump to conclusions regarding the events in boston or try to conflate those events with this legislation schumer said but after schumer made that plea he commented on immigration reform including the specific gang of 8 bill in the context of the boston terror attacks  in general we are a safer country when law enforcement knows who is here has their fingerprints photos et cetera background checks schumer said  in addition both the refugee program and asylum program have been strengthened in the past five years such that we are much more careful about screening people in terms of who should and should not be coming into the country schumer added  if there are any changes that our homeland security experts tell us need to be made i m committed to making them schumer s comments came after the committee s ranking gop member sen chuck grassley r ia mentioned the boston bombing earlier in the hearing schumer s chastisement of his colleagues about mentioning the boston attack appeared to be a response to grassley  we also appreciate the opportunity to talk about immigration particularly in light of all that s happening in massachusetts right now and over the last week grassley said to open the hearing  we are here trying to understand why these events have occurred it s hard to understand that there are people in this world that want to do americans harm so this hearing is an opportunity to refocus on the issues at hand and the importance of remaining vigilant and secure in our homeland according to gallup the percentage of americans saying that they have quite a lot or a great deal of confidence in the church or organized religion went from 68 percent in 1975 to 48 percent in 2013 over the same period those expressing the same amount of confidence in the military has gone from 58 percent to 76 percent this means that on the moral front more liberal views like support for same sex marriage are allowed to quickly spread and have gone from being seen as radical to mainstream but even on this issue we are becoming two americas one where same sex marriage is legal in some states and another where it s specifically outlawed but on the military front it means that revelations about recent government snooping on americans doesn t sound as many alarms as it should have politically it also means that some of the old ideological battle lines on national security have been scrambled so that republicans no longer get all the credit nor democrats all the blame these new realities have changed the conversation about the role and size of government about the line between individual liberty and the collective good about the meaning of personal responsibility and societal responsibility they have also signaled that conservative arguments on many of these issues are losing their resonance nationally and that the republican pool of potential voters is shrinking while the democratic pool expands so to defend themselves their ways of thinking and to their minds their way of life republicans are pulling every lever to slow the change on the state level gerrymandering limiting voter access passing anti immigrant laws cutting assistance to the poor this means we re now at a point where people may not worry as much about all of america as about their slice of america in the tumult and transition of change we may be becoming a nation divided against itself many republicans are enraged over revelations in recent days that the internal revenue service targeted conservative nonprofit groups with a campaign of audits and harassment but of all the troubles now dogging the obama administration including the benghazi fiasco and the justice department s snooping on the associated press the irs episode however alarming is also the least surprising as david burnham noted in a law unto itself the irs and the abuse of power 1990 in almost every administration since the irs s inception the information and power of the tax agency have been mobilized for explicitly emails demonstrate that the targeting of tea party groups was orchestrated from the top  the irs shared information with the fec 2c raising questions about how politicized both agencies were  a poll shows that fewer americans than ever trust the federal government with all the excitement over syria last week we went from assad is hitler to we have achieved peace in our time almost overnight  you may have missed another big story the irs scandal which has slumbered over the summer as congress has been in recess seems to be waking up it has now been over four months since the irs admitted it was targeting conservative groups in the run up to the 2012 election the chief irs official in charge of exempt organizations lois lerner has taken the fifth invoking her right against self incrimination in order to avoid testifying before congress on what went on nonetheless president obama who himself joked about auditing his enemies has lumped the irs misconduct in with what he calls phony scandals but new emails have come out that make the irs scandal look anything but phony emails recovered by the house ways and means committee demonstrate that the targeting of tea party groups and of voter integrity groups was orchestrated from the top of the agency rather than being conducted by a few rogue employees in the cincinnati office of the irs the tea party targeting was regarded by lerner as something very dangerous politically and she observed that cincy should probably not have these cases the emails also reveal lerner s concerns that the democrats might lose their senate majority and her hopes that the federal election commission might save the day by interfering with right leaning grassroots activity the irs also shared information with the fec something not permitted by statute raising questions about just how politicized both agencies were  like the internet video the benghazi terrorist attack was blamed on the only thing phony about the irs scandal is the administration s cover story that a couple of rogue agents in the cincinnati office concocted and executed this most blatant abuse of power by the most powerful and feared agency of government lerner s email further blows out of the water that discredited fiction it also confirms a suspected reason for the planned intimidation and hamstringing of conservative opposition to the obama administration s policies saying that those tea party group applications for tax exempt status could end up being the vehicle to go to court to get more clarity on the 2010 supreme court ruling on campaign finance rules that s right and that s just another reason why we need to get to the bottom of the irs scandal which isn t the least bit phony it seems to me that there are two possible problems here one is that this came from the obama white house the other is that the overwhelmingly democratic career civil service at the irs didn t need white house instructions to go after tea party groups it saw as enemies the first possibility is bad enough but is presumably remediable with stricter rules the second possibility however calls into question the possibility of a nonpartisan career civil service and certainly the possibility of fair administration for something as complex and involving as many discretionary decisions as the internal revenue code worse yet given that overwhelming partisan identification with democrats pervades the civil service as a whole it calls into question the very possibility of a nonpartisan and politically neutral civil service i m not ready to call for a return to the spoils system but the fully politicized federal bureaucracy of our nation s first century or so did have two advantages first presidents couldn t hide behind the bureaucracy as they were presumed responsible for the actions of government bureaus staffed with their supporters and second politicians were less inclined to trust the bureaucracy with enormous and discretionary power when they knew that it would sometimes be staffed by their political adversaries at any rate it all boils down to trust one reason for the resonance of not only the irs scandals but also the nsa scandal the benghazi scandal fast and furious and so on is that fewer americans than ever trust the federal government it s a mess that needs to be cleaned up and denying that the mess exists only exacerbates the lack of trust it s doubtful that eric holder s justice department which is even more partisan and politicized than the irs will clean this mess up nor is holder likely to appoint a special prosecutor so it s up to congressional investigators to get to the bottom of it stay tuned glenn harlan reynolds is professor of law at the university of tennessee and the author of the new school how the information age will save american

week and were promised back pay once a budget is passed and the government reopens but for many rank and file employees who live paycheck to paycheck the shutdown is proving to be a massive financial headache some say their savings have been wiped out after a three year pay freeze and a previous round of furloughs during the summer the nation s ideological battle over healthcare and spending is hitting these workers in the pocketbook they re falling behind on rent car payments credit card debt and other bills  i am in survival mode said timothy maimone a furloughed quality assurance specialist for the department of defense  i am barely squeaking by right now the 51 year old mission viejo resident said he earns just enough to cover the mortgage on his house pay bills and take care of his 7 year old son but the first government shutdown in nearly two decades has him stressed and angry about money a single dad with no savings he s prioritizing bills in case the shutdown goes on for weeks he s already missed his monthly credit card payment and is late on the mortgage he s stopped paying the trash bill and only shelled out the minimum to keep the water on and he s holding off on buying clothes for his son salvatore workers like maimone have been told their last paycheck from working before the shutdown could arrive soon even then they ll get paid only for the days they worked and not the furloughed days that will be settled up later there won t be another check until the government reopens the pain is also spreading to the private sector as many companies with government contracts begin sending workers home aerospace corp based in el segundo furloughed about 2 000 workers san francisco engineering company urs corp has about 3 000 employees on furlough the furloughs are costing the economy at least 160 million per workday according to market research firm ihs inc if the shutdown continues beyond three or four weeks economic growth could be cut in half in the last quarter of the year moody s analytics said the federal government had about 2 15 million people excluding postal workers unaffected by the shutdown on its payroll in august according to the government california alone has about 243 000 federal employees  they are middle class americans said colleen kelley president of the national treasury employees union which represents about 150 000 federal workers  they are frightened about what this means to their families many are the sole supporters of their families kelley s union represents workers from 31 federal agencies and departments such as the treasury and homeland security she said about 40 of the union s members take home a salary less than 50 000 a year  there are tens of thousands of workers who don t have backup plans or a support system she said even those who do have savings are counting their pennies malcolm gettmann 59 and his wife have both been furloughed from their jobs at the internal revenue service in san diego like many other furloughed workers the pair have filed for unemployment benefits and are scrambling to tighten their belts the couple who have some savings said they don t plan to make big purchases any time soon instead gettmann said they now meticulously plan meals and buy only those groceries that are on sale there is just enough to cover their 1 600 mortgage payment and expenses until the third week of november he s not at all impressed by a house bill passed saturday that guarantees back pay to workers once the shutdown ends that pay is only approved when the senate passes it and the president signs it noted gettmann who also serves as the treasury union s chapter president for san diego and imperial counties  meanwhile the mortgage is still due the car payments are still due everything is still due however government workers might be getting some relief on their bills major banks such as wells fargo co and pnc bank say they re working with customers individually others such as td bank are offering no interest payday loans on its website jpmorgan chase co said it was ready to help on financial challenges that might arise much like we worked with our customers through hurricane sandy and tornadoes in oklahoma many credit unions have gone even further to help navy federal credit union the largest credit union in the u s is expediting approval on raising credit card limits and letting members withdraw from certificates of deposit without penalties financial services firm usaa is offering payment deferrals and refunding some fees on credit cards and other services pacific marine credit union in oceanside calif plans to post payrolls for all affected members with direct deposit oct 15 if the government doesn t come through the payments will come out of the union s own cash reserves said brad smith the vice president of strategic development depending on how much is left in the coffers the union will consider making another payment two weeks later if the shutdown continues  we want to provide that peace of mind smith said smith who worked at another california credit union during the 26 day shutdown in 1995 and 1996 said workers are suffering more this time around  there was a much different environment during the clinton era back then it was unprecedented he said  now the government has a track record with furloughs and the sequester it seems like every time you turn around they want to run off the edge of a cliff valentine s day is a time when couples go out for romantic dinners and exchange gifts while singles meet up in bars hoping to make some bad decisions valentine s day is also a day when people with crazy ex boyfriends or girlfriends are reminded of how thankful they are for anti stalking laws every state has made stalking a crime these laws help protect people who might otherwise live in fear yet labor unions have successfully and disconcertingly lobbied to be exempt from anti stalking laws in at least four states california pennsylvania illinois and nevada  the most glaring examples of union favoritism under state laws notes a 2012 u s chamber of commerce report tend to occur in criminal statutes and allow individuals who engage in truly objectionable behavior to avoid prosecution solely because they are participating in some form of labor activity pennsylvania unions now enjoy a loophole that the state s anti stalking law shall not apply to conduct by a party to a labor dispute in illinois anti stalking laws exempt any controversy concerning wages salaries hours working conditions or benefits the making of collective bargaining agreements these exemptions prove that organizing tactics used by unions can have something in common with those of stalkers and can perhaps inflict similar emotional distress while a number of states have exemptions that have allowed union members to intimidate and harass california is by far the worst actor as in other states it is a crime in california to interfere with a lawful business through physical obstruction or intimidation of workers or customers yet california has exempted unions from this law the negative effects were clear in 2008 when united food and commercial workers union members picketed a new ralph s grocery store in fresno they went beyond traditional picketing harassing customers and instigating confrontations with employees on store property when store workers finally called the police authorities refused to come and put a stop to the union s disruptive behavior with the nation s highest income and sales tax rates in addition to many costly regulations california is already one of the most difficult places to do business its exemptions permitting such behavior on the part of unions which would be considered criminal for you or me makes the state an even more inhospitable place to do business california also has a host of exemptions that allow union members to violate the property rights of private citizens the 2008 researcher protection act makes entering the residences of academic researchers to interfere with their work a crime sounds reasonable yet this doesn t apply to union members they can invade a professor s home in california and it s not a crime so long as the invader is engaged in labor union activities you might wonder why unions have lobbied to be exempt from laws against trespassing the fact is that they have a long history of targeting private residences in 2010 roughly 500 protesters from the service employees international union showed up outside the home of a bank of america deputy general counsel to protest the company s policies that bank official wasn t home but his teenage son was and felt forced to barricade himself in a bathroom as union demonstrators surrounded his house and even came onto the front porch unions can also invade your personal space if you re riding public transit in california the california penal code states willfully blocking the free movement of another person in a public transit system is a crime subject to up to 90 days in jail and a 400 fine however california legislators have passed a provision exempting unions this means that union protesters can block the movement of people on public transit so long as it is related to collective bargaining efforts something to keep in mind before getting on bart during your next visit to san francisco labor bosses have even deemed it necessary to get legislators to grant unions exemptions from laws against sabotage wisconsin s state law against sabotage exempts unions so as to not curtail their organizing activities the fact that anti sabotage laws might be construed as an impediment to union organizing says more about union organizing efforts than anything else yet in 2011 union members were alleged to have sabotaged equipment belonging to supporters of governor scott walker s labor reforms in new york and new jersey during a labor dispute between verizon and the communications workers of america the telephone company contacted the fbi to investigate allegations of sabotage the company reported equipment being stolen fiber optic lines cut and an office heating system tampered with during a union organizing effort in ohio the owner of one non union electrical services company had his tires slashed and rocks thrown at his windows one of his employees was assaulted the owner was himself shot in the arm while confronting a person who was vandalizing his car on his property other owners of non union shops experienced similar harassment and intimidation when the associated builders and contractors called on unions to halt such odious behavior the unions responded that their actions were perfectly legal state lawmakers should oppose efforts to exempt unions from anti stalking and anti trespassing laws where such laws are already on the books they should be repealed for union bosses can be like those scary exes who insist they aren t letting you break up with them workers and employers deserve the freedom to tell unions i m just not that into you photo striking vons worker talks to a potential customer

greavesdetroit reuters michigan governor rick snyder cleared the way for a state takeover of detroit declaring that the birthplace of the u s automotive industry faces a fiscal emergency and that he has identified a top candidate to assume its management friday s declaration by the republican governor virtually assures that the state of michigan will assume control of detroit s books and eventually decide whether the city should file the largest municipal bankruptcy in u s history detroit has faced the steepest population decline of any major american city in recent decades once the fifth largest u s city and springboard for music icons such as michael jackson and diana ross it now ranks 18th in size with about 700 000 people  its time to say we should stop going downhill snyder told a forum of residents hand picked by his office at a detroit public television station  there have been many good people who have had many plans many attempts to turn this around they haven t worked he said a report commissioned by snyder has described what it called operational dysfunction in the city government crushing debt of 14 billion and a current fiscal year budget deficit of 100 million detroit mayor dave bing did not attend the announcement nor did city council members appear to be in the audience earlier on friday a majority of the council said they wanted to challenge snyder s decision but did not decide how to proceed while snyder made his announcement on wayne state university s campus a few dozen protesters gathered about two miles away at city hall clutching signs that read snyder go home and this is a takeover the fate of detroit is being watched closely across the country as many cities and towns are still struggling to recover from the housing bust and the deep recession that followed snyder would not identify the top candidate to run detroit or say whether the person was from michigan some residents and restructuring experts have said he should name an african american to manage the city which is 83 percent black referring to the candidate the republican governor said they have vast experience working on relationships they have strong financial knowledge strong legal knowledge and that ability to say how do we build teams and work together the republican governor said of the candidate snyder had acknowledged last week that many qualified people did not want the controversial job the emergency manager will eventually have strong powers to develop a financial plan revise or reject city budgets consolidate departments reduce or eliminate the salaries of elected officials sell eligible assets lay off workers and renegotiate labor contracts reaction in the city ranged from anger to despair and resignation mayor bing a former professional basketball player and steel executive said he did not favor an emergency manager but would try to work with the state of michigan  if in fact the appointment of an emergency financial manager both stabilizes the city fiscally and supports our restructuring initiatives which improve the quality of life for our citizens then i think there is a way for us to work together he said in a statement bing has complained that part of detroit s financial crisis stems from cuts in state funds for the city karen lewis 49 a manager at a fast food store reflected the resentment some residents feel at the takeover of the predominantly black and democratic city by a predominantly white and republican state government  it don t take a genius to know what this is all about said lewis who is black  they want our money and our land no one cares about us and we re the ones who stuck around not the white folks but bernard ragin 41 said he was tired of living in a city that has seen a collapse of basic services  i don t care who fixes detroit as long as the street lights work and the police show up on time he said detroit officials now have 10 days to request a hearing with the governor about his decision snyder said the hearing would be held on march 12 the nine member city council has been preparing to argue that detroit should not have an emergency manager and could also appeal the decision in state court after the hearing snyder will either confirm or revoke the declaration of emergency if he confirms the emergency as expected management of detroit s fiscal affairs would revert to a board composed of three state officials who will be snyder appointees the board would formally appoint an emergency manager although in practice snyder will make the final decision michigan democratic party chairman lon johnson sharply criticized snyder s decision calling it a hostile take over this overthrow of the democratic process is a deeply disappointing moment in our state s history johnson said al garrett president of detroit s biggest union representing municipal employees said efforts are underway to challenge the decision in court but he said the case would have to be filed in federal court rather than state court because the michigan supreme court has a republican majority a court challenge of snyder s decision would not delay the appointment of a manager a state government official said snyder said that detroit s creditors should be brought to the table to renegotiate debt terms by possibly delaying or relieving payments  this should be part of the strategy that needs to take place he said bill maher s new rules on the plea to raise the minimum wage is on point it is hard to understand anyone s objection to it a country cannot frown on citizen s using public assistance if it does not create an economy that pays a living wage to all its citizens that are working the following snippet with the most relevant bullets from his new rules segment on the minimum wage is on point bill maher s new rules snippet on the minimum wage when it comes to raising the minimum wage conservatives always say it is a non starter because it cuts into profits  you might think that paying people enough to live is so self evident that even crazy people could understand it but you would be wrong  michele bachmann is not only against raising the minimum wage she is against having one at all she wants said if we took away the minimum wage we could virtually wipe out unemployment because we would be able to offer jobs at whatever level and naturally ted cruz agrees ted cruz thinks it s a good thing that when his cuban father came to america he was paid fifty cents an hour to work as a dishwasher  when did the american dream become this pathway to indentured servitude this economic death spiral where workers get paid next to nothing so they can only afford to buy next to nothing so businesses are forced to sell cheaper and cheaper shit consider the fact that most fast food workers whose average age by the way is 29 are on some form of public assistance which is not surprising when even working people can t make enough to live they take money from the government this is the question the right has to answer do you want smaller government with less handouts or do you want do you want a low minimum wage because you cannot have both if coronel sanders isn t going to pay the lady behind the counter enough to live on then uncle sam has to and i for one is getting a little tired of helping highly profitable companies pay their workers bill maher makes a very important statement the average american citizens are subsidizing mcdonald s americans are subsidizing all companies that are paying below subsistence level wages the viral story of a mcdonald s employee calling a mcdonald s help line is probative mcdonald s gave her information necessary to get government assistance and charity this was a full time worker what she really needs is an increase in the minimum wage what she needs is the dignity of pay she can live on bill maher is late to the party george carlin figured out long time ago that the american dream had become a pathway to indentured servitude he laid it out in his the american dream standup skit the minimum wage is part of the problem however the problem of the poor and working middle class is much deeper the problem is income and wealth disparity that is getting worse income and growth is extracted from the poor and the middle class with policies to ensure the incessant steady growth of the wealth and income of a very few like my facebook page visit my blog egbertowillies com follow egbertowillieslet s be clear jan brewer is not an idiot she may have been the rising star and darling of the far right of the arizona republican party but she s not a black helicopter republican consider the gold coin bill this pile of arble garble had two reasons behind it there was the reason that the national press got the need to give opportunities to gold savers to spend their gold which defeats the purposes of gold saving then there was the actual reason that circulated on the ground obama was going to spend so much money that the dollar was just going to continue inflating so much it would be useless and arizona needed to be prepared prepared i say nevermind that the facts dictate that neither inflation nor federal spending have exactly been rocketing into the sun they know the black helicopter caucus has given us the agenda 21 ban forced oaths of loyalty a pee bill not joking and neither were they and defended your right to hate granted this has provided arizona with some excellent political entertainment but walk through the governor s signatures of these bills the agenda 21 ban signed pee bill killed in the house due to global outrage turning it completely toxic thanks everybody the gold coin bill vetoed for technical reasons but what jan brewer cares about is jan brewer that lovely religious anarchy bill she wrote in a letter that she regretted vetoing it but she shot that hostage and four more dead to get ahcccs expansion now to someone who has lived here for years i feel the need to inform all of you who have not of a simple truth arizona is not normal i do not mean weird the way most out of state folk mean it i do not mean crazy i mean there s the way the rest of the south runs then there s how the south runs and then there s arizona arizonans like the political theater we re the state that produced both sinema and mccain both brewer and grijalva we expect them to be colorful energetic full of ideas and brilliant speeches and if they are anything less we tend to just stay home and let the other guy win now in terms of colorful jan brewer is a damn rainbow the electoral issue for her is to whom her colors appeal arizona s demographics are shifting at a breathtaking pace the state is rapidly turning younger and browner the electorate is moving steadily leftward on high visibility issues now were jan brewer running for governor again she d ve taken the medicaid money and not moved on immigratiion but brewer can t run for governor she s term limited she can however run for mccain s seat in 2016 consider mccain s behavior he s back to work on his legacy issue immigration on immigration he reality checked his own party on drones he all but body checked rand paul he s monkeying in syria rumored to be scuttling russian american talks on the subject mccain is spending political capital like a sailor spends cash which only makes sense for one reason he s getting done mccain will be 80 when his term ends generic old at this age usually raises the r word but lest we forget the man valiantly served his country under what can only be described as the most harrowing of circumstances and carries the physical scars that go with it i may not always agree with his politics but he s generally proved himself to be an upright man whose convictions are real he s earned the right to shore up his reputation settle some old scores and live out his days in well earned peace on his cornville ranch that said in my opinion all signs point to brewer burnishing her legacy in the hopes that in 2016 she ll be remembered more for medicaid expansion than for sb1070 for denying dreamers their licenses for selling the capitol and on and on the list goes the reason is simple she is gambling that by the 2016 senate race if she can run as the governor that worked across the aisle she can force the democrat to run negative against her and democrats do not win when we run negative there s only one catch this strategy relies on collective amnesia we would do well to let that stop being a feature of the american electorate she s no less extreme and calculating a politician after medicaid than before it and the media especially the liberal media should remember all of her tenure from 2009 to 2014 not from january til now so america do arizona a favor stop white washing jan brewer she doesn t deserve it it s not just the poor rollout of the affordable care act to review obama worked congress hard on gun control measures it failed he was hands off with congress on immigration reform it failed he pushed to avert sequestration cuts they were enacted he argued for unemployment benefits to be extended they weren t revelations of aggressive investigations into national security leaks led to a review of justice department activities revelations that the irs had screened tea party groups led to a reworking of the tax agency s practices revelations of the national security agency s broad surveillance programs endorsed by obama led to popular revulsion a court rebuke another review and likely reforms  i have now been in office five years close to five years was running for president for two years before that and for those who ve covered me during that time we have had ups and we have had downs he said  i think this room has probably recorded at least 15 near death experiences as proof that his rumored demise may be premature obama noted recent legislative activity and the prospect of a continued thaw obama s defenders meanwhile argued that some 2013 setbacks should be placed in context the irs scandal lost fizz when it became clear that the agency had screened progressive groups too sequestration relief was passed during the year end budget deal even the stalled immigration reform effort has an upside  we actually aren t quite as gloomy about this year said matt bennett senior vice president for public affairs and a co founder of the centrist democratic group third way  yes the aca rollout was very rocky but if they get their act fully together on that he may be in for a more productive year in 2014 than many expect he got a really good immigration bill out of the senate and there is hope in the house once the primary filing deadlines pass  we actually made some headway on gun safety getting a vote on final passage and a handful of republicans is nothing to sneeze at so we see a few green shoots of course we don t yet know if they are flowers or weeds  the fact is you start out wanting to talk about and work on one set of issues and then events drag you to other places axelrod said pointing to the newtown shootings and syrian civil war as examples  that is really the story of this year  a lot of it has to do with random events and orchestrated subversion on the part of the opposition certainly there were moments during the year when the president was forced off of his agenda white house officials had planned a big jobs related legislative push in january for example before the docket was overwhelmed by gun control other democrats argued that the kinks of the political system did obama in with republicans rewarded above all else for obstinacy  no white house is perfect and everyone makes mistakes but i do think the structural problems overwhelmed everything else because it just became apparent that nothing could happen said bennett  the degree of dysfunction was historic  he could have been lincoln in 1863 and he wouldn t have been able to do anything mike lux who served as obama s liaison to the progressive community during the 2008 white house transition and has been critical of the administration since argued that self assuredness played a damaging role preventing obama and his team from seeing problems on the horizon when would be allies warned the white house about the looming dangers of health care insurance cancelations or the potential backlash to a larry summers federal reserve nomination the advice was heard but not necessarily heeded  i feel like the white house goes it alone too much said lux  in advance of a battle or even in the early stages of a problem it doesn t seem like they have gone out of their way to build unity and cohesion in the party and with progressive allies  there were people like me who at the end of 2009 were saying you have got to start messaging in a coherent way about not only health care but about what you are going to do about jobs and reigning in the power of banks protecting consumers against predatory lending and credit practices that the average person was furious about said westen that stuff was all clearly predictable by the end of 2009 where i would fault him now is that i think he is doing the same thing again before this midterm election a request for comment from the white house was not returned but it seems clear already that obama and his team see value in westen s point in recent weeks the administration has begun focusing on income inequality wage stagnation and the need to spur job growth aides stressed that one of the first orders of business in 2014 will be getting unemployment insurance renewed  the core issue of the 2012 campaign was strengthening economic security for the middle class said one former white house official  the question is whether putting every other issue on the back burner and focusing on that out of the gate would have changed the outcomes my answer maybe not significantly but somewhat  why is the nation more bitterly divided today than it s been in 80 years why is there more anger vituperation and political polarization now than even during joe mccarthy s anti communist witch hunts of the 1950s the tempestuous struggle for civil rights in the 1960s the divisive vietnam war or the watergate scandal if anything you d think this would be an era of relative calm the soviet union has disappeared and the cold war is over the civil rights struggle continues but at least we now have a black middle class and even a black president while the wars in iraq and afghanistan have been controversial the all volunteer army means young americans aren t being dragged off to war against their will and although politicians continue to generate scandals the transgressions don t threaten the integrity of our government as did watergate and yet by almost every measure americans are angrier today they re more contemptuous of almost every major institution government business the media they re more convinced the nation is on the wrong track and they are far more polarized undoubedly social media play a part allowing people to pop off without bearing much responsibility for what they say and most of us can cocoon within virtual or real communities whose members confirm all our biases and assumptions meanwhile cable news and yell radio compete for viewers and listeners by being ever more strident not long ago i debated a republican economic advisor on a cable tv program during the brief station break the show s producer told me to be angrier i told her i didn t want to be angrier  you have to she said  viewers are surfing through hundreds of channels and will stop for a gladiator contest we ve also lost most living memory of an era in which we were all in it together the great depression and world war ii when we succeeded or failed together in those years we were palpably dependent on one another and understood how much we owed each other as members of the same society but i think the deeper explanation for what has happened has economic roots from the end of world war ii through the late 1970s the economy doubled in size as did almost everyone s income almost all americans grew together in fact those in the bottom fifth of the income ladder saw their incomes more than double americans experienced upward mobility on a grand scale yet for the last three and a half decades the middle class has been losing ground the median wage of male workers is now lower than it was in 1980 adjusted for inflation in addition all the mechanisms we ve used over the last three decades to minimize the effects of this descent young mothers streaming into paid work in the late 1970s and 1980s everyone working longer hours in the 1990s and then borrowing against the rising values of our homes are now exhausted and wages are still dropping the median is now 4 percent below what it was at the start of the so called recovery as a result many have come to believe that the deck is stacked against them importantly both the tea party and the occupier movements began with the bailouts of wall street when both groups concluded that big government and big finance had plotted against the rest of us the former blamed government the latter blamed wall street when average people feel the game is rigged they get angry and that anger can easily find its way into deep resentments of the poor of blacks of immigrants of unions of the well educated of government robert b reich chancellor s professor of public policy at the university of california at berkeley was secretary of labor in the clinton administration time magazine named him one of the ten most effective cabinet secretaries of the last century he has written thirteen books including the best sellers aftershock and the work of nations his film inequality for all will be out in september he is also a founding editor of the american prospect magazine and chairman of common cause 1 revisions in truth the most important parts of any jobs report are the revisions to the past two jobs reports that s because the initial estimate of how many jobs we added or lost in any given month is typically off by about 100 000 jobs that s how you get situations like august 2011 when the jobs report said we created no jobs but we later learned we d created more than 100 000 revisions are where we get that better information they re the most accurate part of the unemployment numbers and in this latest jobs report they re a huge disappointment the change in total nonfarm payroll employment for june was revised from 188 000 to 172 000 and the change for july was revised from 162 000 to 104 000 that means we added 74 000 fewer jobs than we thought in june and july 2 the unemployment rate dropped for the worst reason unemployment dropped to 7 3 percent in august huzzah sorry but no there are two reasons the unemployment rate dropped one is that people get jobs huzzah the other is that people stop looking for jobs and so they re no longer counted as technically unemployed that s what happened here the number show 312 000 people dropping out of the labor force that ll be revised but if the truth is anywhere close it s horrible 3 job creation was terrible i know i said initial jobs reports are often misleading and august jobs reports in particular have tended to see sharp upward revisions in recent years but still this report was a bummer 169 000 jobs added plug that into the hamilton project s handy dandy jobs gap calculator and you ll find that this hiring pace will close the jobs gap sometime in 2023 4 unemployment among teenagers african americans and hispanics remains insane among teenagers the unemployment rate is 22 7 percent for african americans it s 13 percent for hispanics 9 3 percent and remember those numbers only count people actively looking for work many others would like to work but have stopped hunting for a job in these communities then the job market is somewhere between an awful recession and a severe depression 5 our political system has given up forget doing something to actually help the economy congress is letting the sequestration crunch jobs and republicans are considering shutting down the government and breaching the debt ceiling meanwhile the federal reserve has been talking loudly about the need for its taper which is fed speak for removing its stimulus support from the economy we re sorry we seem to have lost this page but we don t want to lose you in his speech on the economy this week president barack obama briefly outlined the administration s housing policies for the beginning of his second term here s a look at that policy roadmap the key now is to encourage homeownership that isn t based on bubbles but is instead based on a solid foundation where buyers and lenders play by the same set of rules rules that are clear transparent and fair already i ve asked congress to pass a good bipartisan idea one that was championed by mitt romney s economic advisor to give every homeowner the chance to refinance their mortgage and save thousands of dollars a year what he s talking about in early 2012 the president outlined a series of steps later introduced as three different pieces of legislation in the senate that would help improve refinancing for homeowners who owe more than their homes are worth one of the measures would remove restrictions on the existing harp program or the home affordable refinance program for loans backed by fannie mae and freddie mac including allowing homeowners who had taken out loans after june 2009 to use the program one proposal would move that cut off date to june 2010 the proposal has stalled in the senate but there have been bipartisan discussions in recent months about pairing it with other bills that might pass according to people familiar with those discussions here are the 36 votes against sandy relief a 50 5 billion emergency spending bill to aid victims of super storm sandy it passed in a 62 36 vote in the senate monday evening steve benen did a little math with these votes in the house voted against emergency aid in the senate those 36 votes represent the overwhelming majority of republicans well more than three quarters now approach natural disasters as political fodder another opportunity to push deficit hysteria and to force massive cuts to other domestic spending tax cuts to the wealthy those pay for themselves rebuilding destroyed communities populated by millions of americans only if you cut other government programs in other words the vast majority of republicans are assholes but the king of the assholes at least on this vote is missouri sen roy blunt number three on that list up there of votes against sandy relief let s rewind to may 2011 st louis kmox missouri senator roy blunt says he s asking the federal government to reimburse 100 percent of the cost to local governments dealing with the joplin tornado aftermath  i m asking for 100 percent federal reimbursement to local governments blunt said they ve agreed to 75 i think they have to come to a better number than that and the right number i think would be 100 percent note what s not included in that demand offsets  former colorado gov bill ritter when my father left our family i was 13 years old my mother went on food stamps for a year until she found work as a bookkeeper those food stamps were a lifeline for us i do now know what we would have done otherwise  sen patty murray when my father was diagnosed with ms and to stop working it was food stamps that helped my family keep our heads above the water and put food on the table while my mom looked for work  rep barbara lee when i was a young single mother i was on public assistance it was a bridge over troubled water and without it i wouldn t be where i am today  former rep joe baca as a young veteran food stamps helped me feed my family politicians not the kind of dreamer you respect fear not people go on from food stamps to all kinds of achievement  music moby says food stamps enabled my mom and i to eat without having to ask for hand outs  acting tobey maguire recalled how me and my mom would go into a grocery store and get groceries and pay for them with food stamps and i would run out of the store embarrassed  sports baseball s father son legacy of cecil fielder and prince fielder relied on food stamps early in cecil s career wnba center ruth riley has been outspoken about how free school lunches gave me the energy i needed to learn in school and participate in sports and of course given the sheer number of people who ve participated in nutrition programs over the years there are millions of everyday successful adults teachers lawyers writers chefs executives who would say things similar to what politicians actors musicians and athletes say about how food stamps helped them get through tough times of course not everyone who needs food stamps at some point in their lives goes on to lavish success but as with so many other things about government assistance that s more about poverty than it is about assistance this is after all a nation where rich kids with low test scores are more likely to graduate from college than poor kids with high test scores and where in big parts of the country a kid raised in the bottom fifth of the income scale has less than a 10 percent chance of rising to the top fifth and paul ryan s policies would make those outcomes worse at the same time he s trying to rid himself of the stench of mitt romney by claiming to be some kind of anti poverty crusader anyway paul ryan s own dreams apparently weren t killed by the social security survivor benefits he collected after his father died one of the nation s best known charities is paying disabled workers as little as 22 cents an hour thanks to a 75 year old legal loophole that critics say needs to be closed goodwill industries a multibillion dollar company whose executives make six figure salaries is among the nonprofit groups permitted to pay thousands of disabled workers far less than minimum wage because of a federal law known as section 14 c labor department records show that some goodwill workers in pennsylvania earned wages as low as 22 38 and 41 cents per hour in 2009  if they really do pay the ceo of goodwill three quarters of a million dollars they certainly can pay me more than they re paying said harold leigland who is legally blind and hangs clothes at a goodwill in great falls montana for less than minimum wage  it s a question of civil rights added his wife sheila blind from birth who quit her job at the same goodwill store when her already low wage was cut further  i feel like a second class citizen and i hate it section 14 c of the fair labor standards act which was passed in 1938 allows employers to obtain special minimum wage certificates from the department of labor the certificates give employers the right to pay disabled workers according to their abilities with no bottom limit to the wage most but not all special wage certificates are held by nonprofit organizations like goodwill that then set up their own so called sheltered workshops for disabled employees where employees typically perform manual tasks like hanging clothes the non profit certificate holders can also place employees in outside for profit workplaces including restaurants retail stores hospitals and even internal revenue service centers between the sheltered workshops and the outside businesses more than 216 000 workers are eligible to earn less than minimum wage because of section 14 c though many end up earning the full federal minimum wage of 7 25 when a non profit provides section 14 c workers to an outside business it sets the salary and pays the wages for example the helen keller national center a new york school for the blind and deaf has a special wage certificate and has placed students in a westbury n y applebee s franchise the employees pay ranged from 3 97 per hour to 5 96 per hour in 2010 the franchise told nbc news it has also hired workers at minimum wage from helen keller a spokesperson for applebee s declined to comment on section 14 c helen keller also placed several students at a barnes noble bookstore in manhasset n y in 2010 where they earned 3 80 and 4 85 an hour a barnes noble spokeswoman defended the section 14 c program as providing jobs to people who would otherwise not have the opportunity to work most section 14 c workers are employed directly by nonprofits in 2001 the most recent year for which numbers are available the gao estimated that more than 90 percent of section 14 c workers were employed at nonprofit work centers critics of section 14 c have focused much of their ire on the nonprofits where wages can be just pennies an hour even as some of the groups receive funding from the government at one workplace in florida run by a nonprofit some employees earned one cent per hour in 2011  people are profiting from exploiting disabled workers said ari ne eman president of the autistic self advocacy network  it is clearly and unquestionably exploitation defenders of section 14 c say that without it disabled workers would have few options a department of labor spokesperson said in a statement to nbc news that section 14 c provides workers with disabilities the opportunity to be given meaningful work and receive an income terry farmer ceo of accses a trade group that calls itself the voice of disability service providers said scrapping the provision could force disabled workers to stay at home enter rehabilitation or otherwise engage in unproductive and unsatisfactory activities harold leigland however said he feels that goodwill can pay him a low wage because the company knows he has few other places to go  we are trapped he said  everybody who works at goodwill is trapped leigland a 66 year old former massage therapist with a college degree currently earns 5 46 per hour in great falls his wages have risen and fallen based on time studies the method nonprofits use to calculate the salaries of section 14 c workers staff members use a stopwatch to determine how long it takes a disabled worker to complete a task that time is compared with how long it would take a person without a disability to do the same task the nonprofit then uses a formula to calculate a salary which may be equal to or less than minimum wage the tests are repeated every six months leigland s pay has been higher than 5 46 but it has also dropped down to 4 37 per hour based on the time study results he said he believes goodwill makes the time studies harder when they want his wage to be lower  sometimes the test is easier than others it depends on if as near as i can figure they want your wage to go up or down it s that simple he said his wife sheila 58 spent four years hanging clothes at the great falls goodwill for about 3 50 an hour she said the time study was one of the most degrading and stressful parts about her job  you never know how it s going to come out it stressed me out a lot she said she quit last summer when she returned to work after knee surgery and found that her wage had been lowered to 2 75 per hour a training rate  at 2 75 it would barely cover my cost of getting to work i wouldn t make any money she said harold said he believes goodwill can afford to pay him minimum wage based on the salaries paid to goodwill executives while according to the company s own figures about 4 000 of the 30 000 disabled workers goodwill employs at 69 franchises are currently paid below minimum wage salaries for the ceos of those franchises that hold special minimum wage certificates totaled almost 20 million in 2011 in 2011 the ceo of goodwill industries of southern california took home 1 1 million in salary and deferred compensation his counterpart in portland oregon made more than 500 000 salaries for ceos of the roughly 150 goodwill franchises across america total more than 30 million goodwill international ceo jim gibbons who was awarded 729 000 in salary and deferred compensation in 2011 defended the executive pay  these leaders are having a great impact in terms of new solutions in terms of innovation and in terms of job creation he said gibbons also defended time studies and the whole section 14 c approach he said that for many people who make less than minimum wage the experience of work is more important than the pay  it s typically not about their livelihood it s about their fulfillment it s about being a part of something and it s probably a small part of their overall program he said and goodwill and the organizations that run the sheltered workshops are not alone in their support for section 14 c in many cases the families of the workers who have severe disabilities say their loved ones enjoy the work experience enjoy getting a paycheck and the amount is of no consequence  i feel really good about it i don t have to worry so much about him said fran davidson whose son jeremy has worked at goodwill in great falls montana for more than a decade  i know he s not getting picked on and he s in a safe place he enjoys what he s doing and he s happy and that s what we like for our kids jeremy started out working for a sub minimum wage but did well on his last time study and is currently earning 7 80 an hour montana s minimum wage but foes of section 14 c have hopes for a new bill that s now before congress that would repeal section 14 c and make sub minimum wages illegal across the board  meaningful work deserves fair pay the sponsor of the bill rep gregg harper r miss told nbc news  this dated provision unjustly prohibits workers with disabilities from reaching their full potential the bill is opposed by trade associations for the employers of the disabled and past attempts to change the law have failed but marc maurer president of the national federation of the blind and a foe of the sheltered workshop system is cautiously optimistic that this time the bill will pass and end what he called a two tiered system that system explained maurer says americans who have disabilities aren t as valuable as other people and that s wrong these folks have value we should recognize that value  google we re not in cahoots with the nsa follow open channel from nbcnews com on twitter and facebooknew orleans reuters republican governor bobby jindal said on thursday he wants to eliminate all louisiana personal and corporate income taxes to simplify the state s tax code and make it more friendly to business the governor did not release details of his proposal but his office released a statement confirming that the taxes are targets of a broader tax reform plan  our goal is to eliminate all personal income tax and all corporate income tax in a revenue neutral manner jindal said in the statement he did not confirm reports that he will seek an increase in sales taxes in order to offset lost income tax revenue but said we want to keep the sales tax as low and flat as possible political analyst john maginnis who on thursday reported in his email newsletter lapolitics weekly that jindal will propose balancing the tax loss by raising the sales tax now at 4 percent said the strategy fits with the governor s interest in keeping a high national profile  just proposing a plan on the scale being discussed would win jindal acclaim among fiscal conservatives here and nationwide maginnis told reuters jindal is often mentioned for national office including the u s senate and as a possible presidential candidate louisiana s neighbor texas has had no income tax for years relying on a windfall from its rich energy resources and other forms of taxation other states in the region governed by republicans are trying to copy texas including oklahoma and kansas which have both considered lowering taxes but political analyst maginnis questioned whether the republican majority louisiana legislature would endorse jindal s ambitious plan  any tax increase such as sales tax or elimination of exemptions would require a two thirds vote a form of legislative approval that would require republican solidarity and significant democratic support maginnis said jindal said his team will meet with lawmakers soon to discuss details of his tax reform plan  eliminating personal income taxes will put more money back into the pockets of louisiana families and will change a complex tax code into a more simple system that will make louisiana more attractive to companies who want to invest here and create jobs he said tucson an arizona law that put an end to ethnic studies courses in tucson schools has been largely upheld as constitutional by a federal judge but supporters of the program say their legal fight to restore the program will continue u s circuit court judge wallace tashima on friday found most of the law that bans public schools from teaching certain race related courses such as mexican american studies constitutional with one small exception tashima ruled that the portion of the law that prohibits courses designed for certain ethnic groups was unconstitutionally vague tashima ruled that the provision s wording was broad and ambiguous raising serious constitutional concerns that threaten to chill the teaching of legitimate and objective ethnic studies courses still arizona atty gen tom horne this week called the ruling on hb 2281 a victory for ensuring that public education is not held captive to radical political elements and that students treat each other as individuals not on the basis of the race they were born into horne who wrote the law and those who support it said the mexican american studies program in the tucson school system promoted resentment toward a race or a class of people and advocated ethnic solidarity instead of the treatment of people as individuals defenders of the program rejected that characterization and said it taught often neglected aspects of u s history and inspired latino students to excel in school trustees of the tucson unified school district discontinued the program in january 2012 after state officials determined the program violated the new law the save ethnic studies group based in tucson declared the case not over richard martinez an attorney who filed suit against the law acknowledged tuesday that the legal road ahead would probably be long and steep still he said the group would forge ahead  too much is at stake the right of every student to learn and teacher to teach the history literature and culture of latinos in arizona is currently prohibited the group said in a statement monday  mexican american studies proved to be a valuable educational program in his ruling tashima stated that the arguments made against the law do not meet the high threshold needed to establish a constitutional violation although the judge said the program s defenders failed to show discriminatory intent he found that several aspects of the law and the public debate about it may be viewed to spark suspicion that the latino population has been improperly targeted this single minded focus on terminating the mexican american studies program along with horne s decision not to issue findings against other ethnic studies programs is at least suggestive of discriminatory intent tashima wrote several students and teachers in the district challenged the law on several grounds including that it violated free speech and is unconstitutionally vague in a commencement address in atlanta on sunday to graduating seniors at morehouse college president barack obama told graduates to fulfill the special obligation i felt as a black man like you the all male historically black liberal arts college was also the alma mater of dr martin luther king jr among other famous graduates the president told the graduating students that their background meant they had a duty to create greater justice both in your own community but also across our country to make sure everyone has a voice everyone gets a seat at the table to make sure that everyone no matter what they look like or where they come from or who they love gets a chance to walk through those doors of opportunity if they want it bad enough obama cited his own life as an example several times during his speech touting his success as a father while also acknowledging some bad choices he made in his youth a veiled reference to his admitted past drug use which obama has often acknowledged in books speeches and debates he also admonished morehouse graduates who aimed to join the professions that they ought to serve the poor so yes go get that law degree but ask yourself if the only option is to defend the rich and powerful or if you can also find time to defend the powerless yes go get your mba or start that business but ask yourself what broader purpose your business might serve in putting people to work or transforming a neighborhood some of you may be headed to medical school to become doctors but make sure you heal folks in underserved communities who really need it too in one portion of his speech the president touted obamacare and encouraged the graduates to sign up for the new health insurance exchanges created by his signature legislation obama seems to have been carrying out the advice of dr ezekiel emanuel brother of obama s former chief of staff who argued recently in the wall street journal that young americans would have to be targeted by a propaganda campaign if the system were not to be dangerously underfunded every commencement address by an administration official should encourage young graduates to get health insurance dr emanuel wrote obama advised the graduating class that racism could no longer be leaned upon as a reason for failure we ve got no time for excuses he said he also acknowledged that the u s had become tolerant enough to elect a black president and yet obama described a nation in which discrimination is still rampant see as morehouse men many of you know what it s like to be an outsider to be marginalized to feel the sting of discrimination that s an experience that so many other americans share hispanic americans know that feeling when someone asks where they come from or tells them to go back gay and lesbian americans feel it when a stranger passes judgment on their parenting skills or the love they share muslim americans feel it when they re stared at with suspicion because of their faith any woman who knows the injustice of earning less pay for doing the same work she sure feels it the premise of obama s claim is at odds with recent global survey data which indicates that the u s is among the least racist countries in the world it is also at odds with the record of his own political career in the recent past president obama has been guilty of many of the sins described above touting deportations of illegal immigrants opposing gay marriage until a year ago moving muslims out of campaign photographs for fear of arousing prejudice and most notoriously paying women less than men in both his senate and white house offices overall president obama s remarks repeated a pattern of recent graduation speeches in which he minimized individual achievement in favor of collective obligation curiously he barely mentioned government which he has been at great pains to defend in some recent addresses speeches that have drawn wider criticism in the wake of recent scandals involving abuses of government power the word government appeared five times in his recent ohio state commencement speech but not once in the morehouse address where the only mentions of government careers were his own presidency and the atlanta mayoralty of maynard jackson obama s emphasis at morehouse was on voluntary service to the community a theme closer to the american philosophical tradition albeit reformulated to suit the policies and prerogatives of the administration and the democratic party how would you feel if aides to the president of the united states singled you out by name for attack and if you were featured prominently in the president s re election campaign as an enemy of the people what would you do if the white house engaged in derogatory speculative innuendo about the integrity of your tax returns suppose also that the president s surrogates and allies in the media regularly attacked you sullied your reputation and questioned your integrity on top of all of that what if a leading member of the in july two dozen accomplished women bankers law firm partners and technology executives sat christine c quinn down in a conference room in the met life building for some honest talk about her quest to become new york s first female mayor they were getting worried they told her as they watched her slip in the polls and struggle to respond to attacks the participants including mary ann tighe the real estate executive and diana l taylor girlfriend of the current mayor warned ms quinn that a woman seeking power always faced perils and that the very qualities that had brought her this far drive ambition toughness could make her unlikable to many but ms quinn was not interested in talking about that  i don t get up in the morning thinking about how i ll approach this as a woman or a lesbian i think about the issues she said according to an organizer of the session edison n j gov chris christie attacked new jersey democrats for their push to increase taxes and promised to reverse job losses during a speech wednesday to state business leaders in an expansive 40 minute address that had the tone of a campaign speech christie said republicans and democrats had core philosophical differences on taxes and spending the governor promised to veto any new tax increase passed by the democratic controlled legislature as he has done in the past  let there be no confusion about the philosophies of the two parties as we enter this election year republicans think you are overtaxed said christie while speaking before naiop a commercial real estate association  democrats believe you are undertaxed blow s final two paragraphs which come immediately after referencing bibeau read as follows that is because as talking points memo says obama voters would have received almost exactly 3 5 of the electoral vote compared to their actual population 30 7 percent of the electoral vote over 51 percent of the popular vote this is not where we should be in 2013 debating whether to pass bills to reduce urban voters to a fraction of the value of other voters and hoping that someone with the power to stop it thinks it s a bad idea the bill will not become law in virginia a key republican state senator opposes it so it might not even get out of committee in the state senate the lt gov opposes it and since he has already said he will not break 20 20 ties that are strictly partisan and the senate is split 20 20 between the two parties even if it reached the floor he seems committed to killing it and the governor opposes it so even were it to reach his desk he seems committed to vetoing it it is worth noting that unlike the two states that now distribute electoral votes by congressional district maine which has never split and nebraska which in 2008 gave on e ev to obama and as far as i know all other current proposals rather than giving the two ev votes equivalent to the two senators to the candidate winning the statewide total the virginia proposal would award the final two evs to the candidate winning the majority of the congressional districts not the majority of the state s votes those districts were heavily gerrymandered because in 2008 the dems had won 6 of the state s electoral votes and even though glenn nye and tom perriello and rick boucher were defeated in 2010 the republicans were taking no chances and redrew the cds to make them more republican friendly obama actually won one cd represented by a republican the proposal came from a state senator whose intention seems racist he wants rural for which you can read white voters not to be outvoted by urban for which you can read black and to a lesser degree hispanic voters it will not go anywhere it is ironic that the vote distribution turned out to so closely match the ratio of the 3 5 compromise but then part of the pushback against obama has from the beginning been because he was black odd that the ratio would now increasingly include young people and women as well as people of color again it won t happen in virginia it seems like the parallel in florida is also dead because the republican heads of the two chambers of the state legislature are opposed to splitting the electoral vote but let s be clear the intent of such proposal is not merely to steal states for republicans that they might not otherwise win it is to diminish the value of the votes of minorities and expand the power of angry old white men like the attempts this past cycle at voter suppression through voter id laws and limiting access to early voting this will produce a backlash perhaps those pushing such proposals really do want to make obama voters count for only 3 5 in the process what they might be demonstrating is that they themselves have only 3 5 the intelligence and moral character of those whose votes they seek to diminish  new terms of use do not sell my personal information this material may not be published

up without their klan hoods to show themselves to the world at president obama s speech in arizona obama foes at one point sang bye bye black sheep a derogatory reference to the president s skin color while protesters like deanne bartram raised a sign saying impeach the half white muslim many on both sides wore red white and blue and carried small flags  he needs to go back to where he came from because obviously he is a liar she said  i am not racist i am part indian obama s half black half white he s 47 percent negro shouted ron enderle a 77 year old chandler resident who said that he and his son served as marines and his grandson is currently serving in the marines  we have gone back so many years she said  he s divided all the races i hate him for that this is today s republicans bunch of fucking ignorant bigots i m proud to have voted for barack obama update i went to a baseball game right after i wrote this unfortunately the dodgers are kicking the cards asses tonight arizona blue had sent me some links to other diaries on this several hours ago here they are for your reading pleasure hundreds protest president obama in phoenix and it wasn t pretty rwnjs so stupid they screwed up own anti president obama racist chants blame him for their racismpresident obama s historic election in 2008 and his reelection last year proved decisively that race is no longer an insurmountable hurdle to high political office in the united states but the current pool of possible candidates suggests that the next black president will not be taking the oath of office anytime soon  in the shadow of barack obama there s not been a lot of growth cornell belcher a pollster who was involved in the president s 2008 campaign said  it is really hard for minorities to get elected at the statewide level and before you start talking about president frankly you have to get elected to statewide office the notion of a post obama reformation of black politics has not been borne out at the ballot box as black politicians continue to struggle to win the statewide offices that are the traditional paths to the presidency while the election of the first black president marked a significant break from the country s history of racial prejudice race still matters the vast majority of black elected officials are put into office by black voters even obama needed large numbers of black and latino votes to win particularly last year when a majority of whites voters voted for someone else ashley bell a former county official in georgia who switched from the democratic to the republican party with an eye on a future run for statewide office said that obama did convince a lot of young black politicians that they can aspire to crossover offices we may not live in a post racial america but i think we do live in a new era of politics where on either side of the aisle everyone knows that a good political candidate is one with crossover appeal be they white or black or latino while the country s changing demographics will favor political leaders of color in the future the current landscape remains challenging for minority candidates seeking statewide office particularly governorships and u s senate seats the typical steppingstones to presidential bids deval l patrick d mass currently is the nation s only black governor and tim scott r s c is the only black member of the senate having recently been appointed to fill a vacancy patrick 56 is often mentioned as a potential presidential candidate but he has said he has no plans to run in 2016 no other black politicians names have come up on the short list of credible contenders for the next national election on the gop side of the aisle former secretary of state condoleezza rice has been mentioned as a possible candidate but has steadfastly denied any interest colin powell who preceded rice as president george w bush s secretary of state was once a favored gop prospect but he also declined to run most recently herman cain a black georgia businessman was briefly a hit among republican grass roots activists in the run up to the primaries but he dropped his candidacy after a woman revealed a longtime extramarital affair and other women accused him of sexual harassment obama s political trajectory was extraordinary for any political figure he rocketed to the top tier of national politics after a stirring speech at the 2004 democratic national convention where he used his personal story and oratorical skills to call for uniting a country long divided by race and partisan politics his election that year to the senate was helped by the implosion of his strongest opponents in the primary and general elections obama was the third african american to be elected to the senate since reconstruction when he won the seat from illinois seat in 2004 patrick is only the second black governor elected since that period black politicians seeking to build cross racial coalitions must make sure they don t alienate black voters with their appeals to white and others former washington mayor adrian m fenty d whose name was often included in the list of black political leaders who like obama crossed the old lines of racial politics lost his bid for a second term after african american voters deemed him more concerned with pleasing the city s growing white professional class newark mayor cory booker d whose name is still on the a list of nouveau black pols struggled to overcome the skepticism of african american voters in his first unsuccessful mayoral campaign booker a rhodes scholar who grew up in harrington park n j an upscale suburb of newark lost in 2002 to longtime former mayor sharpe james d who said booker was not black enough the 43 year old booker now in his second term as mayor filed papers this month to form a campaign committee for a senate run in 2014 he also is mentioned as a potential future presidential candidate booker s office did not make him available for an interview scott s performance in south carolina s 2014 senate race if he decides to seek a full term will add to the debate about how much racial politics have changed black residents make up 28 percent of south carolina s population and are solidly democratic the state s republican governor nikki haley is indian american and both she and the 48 year old scott launched their political careers in predominantly white districts artur davis a former house member from alabama worked hard to present himself as a crossover candidate when he set out to become the first black governor of his state but he turned off black voters by distancing himself from obama and alabama s black leadership and failing to pick up significant white support made a surprisingly poor showing in the democratic primary davis who has since joined the republican party and moved to northern virginia acknowledged the challenge faced by black politicians striving to break barriers but he said that each contest is unique  political breakthroughs depend more on the circumstance of one person than some magic alchemy of timing davis wrote in an e mail  if a black with sufficient political skills a fundraising base and a record that appeals to the voters in his or her party emerges that person will be taken seriously in a way that would not have been possible for my parents generation davis predicted that within the democratic party the internal pressure to nominate a white female will be far greater than any impetus to elevate a deval patrick or cory booker in the near future a hispanic might also have a better shot at the white house before another african american there are five hispanic governors and senators most of them republicans including sen marco rubio of florida who at 41 is being touted as presidential timber many post civil rights and generation x black political leaders have demonstrated the political and cultural dexterity to move up to statewide office sometimes in states that have very small black populations such as colorado where 4 3 percent of the residents are black two years ago kamala harris who is of african american and indian american descent was elected attorney general of california a first in a statewide race blacks make up only 6 6 percent of state s population she is often talked about as a future gubernatorial candidate but in alabama where black residents make up 26 5 percent of the population davis lost his primary for governor in 2010 similarly thurbert baker lost in the democratic gubernatorial primary in georgia where nearly a third of the residents are black baker had been elected state attorney general three times for those who manage to win their party s nominations general elections have proven to be be extreme long shots johnny dupree won the mississippi democratic primary for governor in 2011 the first african american to do so in recent history dupree 59 the first black mayor of hattiesburg lost to his republican opponent in the general election by 20 percentage points charles bullock a political scientist at the university of georgia said black candidates in the south most of who are democrats are disadvantaged as much by their party as by their race  georgia and alabama don t have any democrats in statewide office none said bullock said  if you re running statewide and you re a democrat regardless of your ethnicity or your gender you re going to lose more than half of the country s african americans live in the south and continued demographic changes could upend its politics over the next two decades several states are projected to have populations mostly comprised of people of color already there are signs bullock said that in 1996 whites cast 78 percent of all votes in 2008 the percentage was down to 64 percent bullock said voter rolls show that whites made up less than 60 percent of registered voters in georgia last year those nonwhite voters will most likely back democrats bullock said  unless the republicans come up with a broader more encompassing message all they will succeed in getting is white voters but they will ultimately run out of white voters the demographics are changing in favor of minority candidates said andrew kohut of the pew research center in addition to population growth among latinos and asians kohut pointed to a generational change in attitudes about race  it s simple generational demographics really favor minority candidates he said this story has been removed this story has been unpublished and you do not have permission to view it it may have been deleted by its author first says attorney general greg abbott the redistricting is not about race oh no it s about not allowing democrats to vote white democrats too from their brief so basically we just want to fuck over all democrats and if the black and brown people are also hurt well they shouldn t vote for democrats should they it s only collateral damage you know having them actually come right out and say it that they don t want democrats to vote is somehow not surprising but it s good that they re doing it at last but wait there s more to address the actual accusations of racial bias and discrimination texas is using the argument that yeah there may be an isolated incident or two but it s nothing like it was in 1965 from the article which says it better than i can so according to this texas is arguing that section 2 and in fact the entire reasons for preclearance are all based on conditions in 1965 and that since things are better than in 1965 then section 2 is null and void i think the fact that texas is second only to mississippi in section 2 lawsuits is the basis for this particular argument however there is a danger here texas is arguing that only conditions that existed in 1965 would justify federal supervision of the elections process sort of like an originalism to the extreme argument and that can be dangerous because there are those on the supreme court that would like nothing more than the total eradication of the voting rights act not to mention the 13th 14th and 15th amendments but that s another story so i am overjoyed about what happened in texas not the least because it was so unexpected and so freaking great i loved every minute of it and can t tell you how happy i am to have a new democratic hero in wendy davis i want to make this very clear so people will understand what is in my heart as i write this diary i watched the breathless news tonight on msnbc and i saw kos s effort to draft ms davis to run for governor and i m all over it all but there was a part of me that felt so sad too i remember when wisconsin s capitol was filled w that kind of crowd for weeks on end i remember when democrats and progressives in wisconsin filled not only the rotunda of their capitol but all the real estate they could in every direction outside the capitol for weeks on end and most here at the dk supported the effort and it was thrilling then came the recall and we lost i could say why i think this happened but it doesn t matter it just did and since then despite all those thrilling hopeful days things have only gotten worse in wisconsin and one of the biggest ways that has happened is the wisconsin republican answer to seeing that will never happen again as long as they re in power they have made endless laws to make sure of that and now what happened in texas last night will be very difficult for wisconsin to match it s crazy possible in texas almost impossible in wisconsin those of us caught up on the new laws and restrictions regarding what is allowable in the state house and who can be there and under what conditions know how fast after the loss of the recall the gop clamped down on seeing to it that nothing like the anti walker uprising would happen again on their watch i could go on for many paragraphs here telling you how specific and restrictive those new laws are i could roll your socks back as to the totalitarian and successful cap the wisconsin gop has put on anything like what happened in texas yesterday and what happened in wisconsin week after week at one time not so long ago recently the republican wisconsin legislature voted to pass a law similar to what was at stake in texas the gallery was highly restricted women w tape over their mouths to signify protest to the new rules of their being there were told to remove the tape or be arrested they removed the tape and covered their mouths w their hands some democrats in the chamber tried to shout their way into their right to be heard but in the end mike ellis broke his gavel telling everyone to shut the fuck up they would not be heard this disgraceful behavior was shown here a bit on video and god bless her on rachel maddow s show other than that crickets the nation has left the story of wisconsin behind we tried we lost and journalism is not about losers i cheer what happened in texas yesterday with all my heart but beware of the media story on your side today because it can be gone tomorrow and don t underestimate the response of republicans when they have been so challenged i ll bet you the little money i have in the bank that texas too will soon have a bunch of laws that make it impossible for what happened yesterday to happen again the only reason they aren t there now in texas is because what happened surprised the hell out of them don t doubt for a minute that they re gathered in back rooms as i write this figuring out to make sure it never happens to them again i cheer every minute of attention texas gets w this and i cheer wendy davis i don t want it to go away but i know it will my message here is not about cynicism or about don t bother it is not my message is that we are on the brink of so much in this country and we have to find a way to stop letting them get away with this and that means in wisconsin too no matter how gerrymandered it is i frankly don t know how to do this but i do know the answer is not to bow out from the fight in a heap of disappointment and anger and i don t for a minute suggest that s what wisconsin democrats are doing but everything is so much harder for them now wisconsin must find a way to rise again and texas must find a way to hold on to this win and part of that is seeing what s coming and i m telling you what s coming in texas somehow some way we must stop this and that means we have to decide our priorities as democrats and there in lies the rub and i have no answer for it during the 11 years she spent as labor minister in her state ms dreyer a trained lawyer who served as a state prosecutor in bad kreuznach before entering politics as the mayor of that same city became known for tackling problems at the source she held roundtable meetings to discuss the issue of caring for the elderly in nursing homes so that workers could participate her own experiences as the mother of a patchwork family with three children and resident of a publicly sponsored social living project have contributed to her image of being straightforward and someone to whom average people can relate bettina munimus a researcher with the european academy for women in politics and economics based in berlin said that ms dreyer s more consensus oriented approach is indicative of an overall shift visible in the other states where women are now in charge including the biggest north rhine westphalia as well as saarland and thuringia  in the previous generation the old male politicians used the basta style of politics to outwardly demonstrate power and the need for the final word ms munimus said not so the female governors  they know that power is needed to bring about policy but along the way it is important to cooperate to create policy with others that is the identifying factor of this style since 2010 another social democrat hannelore kraft has governed north rhine westphalia germany s most populous state and one known for decades as much for its old boys political network as for its heavy industry ms kraft was forced to settle right after her election for a minority government that relied on the support of political foes to pass legislation together with the deputy governor sylvia löhrmann from the greens ms kraft dubbed her government the invitation coalition and got to work two years later her fragile constellation collapsed and ms kraft faced off against a former minister from ms merkel s conservative party in fresh elections last may not only did ms kraft retain her governorship she won a clear majority in the state legislature for government with the greens many germans would have liked to see ms kraft run as the social democratic candidate challenging ms merkel for the chancellorship in september elections a recent survey by statista pollsters showed the 51 year old the third most popular politician in the country after ms merkel and joachim gauck the german president new nbc poll confirms an early reality check on 2016 1 gop remains divided 2 dem party is pretty unified around hillary clinton and 3 democrats continue to benefit from the same demographic trends that helped obama in 08 and 12 what s more the media see the new republic piece appear more eager for a dem challenger to hillary than democrats are see our nbc poll pro hillary super pac holds finance meeting in new york wsj fewer than 50 000 have enrolled in the federal health care exchange and herring now leads obenshain by a mere 117 votes in the va ag race  a reality check on 2016 yes it s early and yes 2008 taught us that the early front runners clinton and giuliani don t always end up as the presidential nominees but our new nbc news poll looking ahead to the 2016 presidential election reconfirms three current political realities one the republican party is divided according to the poll 32 of republican and republican leaning respondents say they would vote for new jersey gov chris christie in a gop presidential primary while 31 prefer another republican candidate never mind the other third who are undecided so together 68 of gopers are not on board with christie two the democratic party is pretty unified by comparison in the poll 66 of democratic or democratic leaning respondents say they d back hillary clinton in a presidential primary versus just 14 who say they d vote for another democratic candidate and 34 total who claim not to be for hillary yet and three democrats continue to benefit from demographic trends that will be difficult for the gop to overcome in 2016 and beyond in a hypothetical matchup between clinton and christie the poll finds the former democratic secretary of state getting the support of 44 of all adults while the republican governor gets 34 you might not think you need a poll to tell you these things but a poll certainly helps to reinforce them  christie vs a generic republican as mentioned above our poll shows republicans split over christie 32 would back him in a gop primary versus 31 who would support another republican candidate and it s instructive to study the crosstabs to see where christie over performs and under performs here he over performs among women 35 minorities 46 seniors 48 and people in the northeast 57 you know the folks who don t dominate republican primaries but he under performs among men 28 republicans ages 18 29 a la the rand paul crowd 15 upper income republicans 26 and residents in the midwest 30 south 27 and west 22 or the republicans who do dominate republican primaries this geographical divide is especially striking 57 support in the northeast but just 27 in the south and 22 in the west  clinton vs a generic democrat it s equally instructive to see where clinton over performs against another democrat she gets 70 among females 70 among whites 71 among seniors 72 among the lowest income democrats and 73 in the northeast and 70 in the midwest where she underperforms is among men 62 college grads 62 and 60 among upper income democrats these are the remnants of obama s white coalition in the 08 democratic race but a reality check here she s still getting sixty percent among these folks which suggests there isn t really a substantial opening for another democratic candidate whether it s joe biden elizabeth warren or anyone else remember in 2005 there was some real clinton fatigue among democrats that provided the opening for obama that s not the evidence right now  demography continues to be destiny as for our hypothetical general election matchup between clinton and christie hillary is benefitting from the same demographic trends that helped president obama win election in 2008 and re election in 2012 she leads christie among african americans 83 4 respondents ages 18 to 29 45 31 and latinos 44 33 clinton also holds the advantage with residents from the northeast 52 35 west 43 30 the south 43 35 and midwest 41 37 and she has a narrow edge among independents 39 35 christie meanwhile leads among whites 41 37 seniors 44 41 and respondents with the highest incomes 46 34 just what republicans want to hear they are the part of old rich white people  by the way see today s new l a times poll of californians which should be a wakeup call to gop officials nationally folks these numbers are pretty similar to the splits we saw between obama and romney in 2012 and the downside of being the electability candidate for republicans you better be leading or close to it against clinton and you better be performing better among particular demographic groups than romney did right now christie isn t doing either  press appears to be more eager for a dem challenger to hillary than democrats are the political story that went viral yesterday was the new republic piece on elizabeth warren and whether she might challenge hillary clinton in 2016 despite hillary s numbers we mentioned above from the article in addition to being strongly identified with the party s populist wing any candidate who challenged clinton would need several key assets the candidate would almost certainly have to be a woman given democrats desire to make history again she would have to amass huge piles of money with relatively little effort above all she would have to awaken in democratic voters an almost evangelical passion as it happens there is precisely such a person her name is elizabeth warren but here is the potential danger for clinton the political press corps appears to be more eager to search for a challenger for clinton than democrats are just see our poll  about that pro hillary super pac there s one more piece of 2016 news worth mentioning today  on tuesday former obama top aide mitch stewart and a dozen or so other political operatives and 170 donors will gather in new york to plot how to help mrs clinton win in 2016 the meeting is the first national finance council strategy meeting of ready for hillary a super pac devoted to building a network to support mrs clinton s potential presidential ambitions the new york times writes folks it will be interesting to look through the ready for hillary fec report when it comes out which consultants are making money  paper fewer than 50 000 have enrolled in the federal exchange turning from 2016 to the troubled obamacare rollout the wall street journal is reporting that fewer than 50 000 people had successfully navigated the troubled federal health care website and enrolled in private insurance plans as of last week two people familiar with the matter said citing internal government data the figure is a fraction of the obama administration s target of 500 000 enrollees for october but three caveats worth noting 1 the 50 000 figure doesn t include those who signed up via the better running state websites 2 it doesn t include those who received insurance via expanded medicaid and 3 the administration always assumed most people would purchase their insurance in december given that the insurance doesn t take effect until jan 1 and the fact that the federal exchange is behind schedule shouldn t surprise anyone the website after all hasn t been working as one health insurer told the journal given the problems we have witnessed and experienced that 40 000 to 50 000 number is actually higher than i expected  herring now leads obenshain in the va ag race by 117 votes and lastly in the final undecided race from election day 2013 it appears that democrat mark herring has taken the lead over republican mark obenshain in virginia s thisclose race for attorney general the washington post herring had started the day trailing his republican opponent by a mere 17 votes out of 2 2 million cast but as jurisdictions across the state continued to scrub their vote counts the state board of elections showed herring with a 117 vote lead late monday more from the post local jurisdictions have until tuesday at 6 p m to report their results to the state board of elections the state then is scheduled to certify the results on nov 25 if the margin is less than 1 percent either candidate can request a recount if the margin is less than 0 5 percent the state will pay for the recount and it certainly looks like we re headed for a recount click here to sign up for first read emails text first to 622639 to sign up for first
