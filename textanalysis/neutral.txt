all democrats on the committee along with sen orrin hatch r utah and gang of eight republican sens lindsey graham r s c and jeff flake r ariz voted in favor of the bill which will now go to the senate floor sen john cornyn r texas who voted against the bill out of committee said he would support allowing it to move forward for debate rather than joining a filibuster once on the senate floor sen chuck grassley r iowa who was also a no vote said if it had been between his vote and moving the bill to the senate floor he would have voted in favor  the dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us and it is long past time for reform judiciary chairman patrick leahy d vt said before the bill s passage  i hope that our history our values and our decency can inspire us finally to take action we need an immigration system that lives up to american values and helps write the next great chapter in american history by reinvigorating our economy and enriching our communities one of the final issues to settle was over high skilled worker visas called h1 bs an amendment that simplifies the process for companies to bring in workers in science technology engineering and math eventually passed on a voice vote hatch and schumer came to a compromise that led hatch to agree to vote the full bill out of committee although he did not commit to supporting its eventual passage some measures praised highly by immigrant rights advocates never went to a vote leahy brought up his amendment to allow lgbt couples equal protection under immigration law but withdrew it with a heavy heart when it became clear democrats were willing to drop it so the bill would pass a number of provisions lauded by advocates did make it in the committee voted on monday to approve blumenthal s amendment that would block immigration raids in sensitive areas such as schools hospitals and places of worship except in extreme circumstances a separate blumenthal measure to restrict the use of solitary confinement in immigrant detention also passed on monday also on a voice vote although many republican amendments failed some gop senators such as hatch were more successful than others the committee voted on monday to require a mandatory biometric exit system at airports with the highest volume of international air travel something sen jeff sessions r ala wanted to do nationwide but without success amendments deemed poison pills failed unsurprisingly sen ted cruz r texas attempted to add a change that would strip the bill of its path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants which is considered absolutely necessary to the bill by president barack obama democrats and some republicans five republicans voted for that amendment while three hatch graham and flake joined democrats in opposing it leahy said the amendment would gut the bill while sen chuck schumer d n y said it goes against everything america stands for sen dick durbin d ill similarly disparaged another failed cruz amendment this one to bar currently undocumented immigrants from ever being eligible for welfare benefits such as medicaid and food stamps saying he doesn t think such an america is one he d want to live in sessions was also unsuccessful in his efforts to amend the bill offering 49 amendments and seeing nearly every one that went for a vote fail on one amendment last week sessions was the sole yes vote with all of his republican colleagues abandoning him in his effort to limit legal immigration sen mazie hirono d hawaii was one of the rare democrats to offer an amendment that the gang of eight took down schumer and durbin told her they had to reluctantly oppose her attempt on tuesday to add a change that would expand family visas so that people in extreme hardship could petition for green cards for their adult children or siblings it failed with 7 votes in support and 11 against including democrats schumer durbin and sen dianne feinstein d calif all of whom said it was a good amendment but would upset the delicate balance of the gang of eight bill  none of the committee members got everything they wanted and neither did i but in the end we all owe it to the american people to get the best possible result over the finish line he said in a statement  i encourage the full senate to bring this bipartisan bill to the floor at the earliest possible opportunity and remain hopeful that the amendment process will lead to further improvements now that the bill passed the senate judiciary committee it has to go to the senate floor where gang of eight members are hopeful it will pass schumer and mccain who is not on the judiciary committee have said they would like to win over a majority of both parties around 70 votes in total  new terms of use do

with the extension says her lawyer alan raul the government says it needs the time to sort through the allegations in the 65 page complaint it doesn t help justice department lawyers say that pentagon employees have been furloughed because of sequestration  we are pleased that the federal government appears to be taking this case seriously and is taking extra time to conduct its internal inquiry in response to this lawsuit raul said in a statement kelley had been an unpaid social liaison to the military and had hosted parties for military officials including petraeus and gen john allen at her home on tampa s bayshore boulevard the headquarters of central command which oversees military action in the middle east is a few miles away petraeus extramarital affair with his biographer paula broadwell was exposed after kelley complained to the fbi about harassing e mails she had received broadwell was behind them allen s name also popped up in kelley s e mails that prompted then defense

material raul said the following irresponsible police action reported by khou s rucks russell should scare many here is the story as reported a young 13 year old dancer landry thompson came to houston from oklahoma she travelled with her two dance instructors over the weekend the intent of their visit was to train all weekend with some of the best in dance industry when they left the studio saturday night they stopped at a gas station very exhausted as they searched for their lodging they were trying to locate their hotel on the gps out of nowhere they were surrounded by the houston police the houston police dragged them out of the car and handcuffed them all  i was kind of freaked out and surprised by it said landry thompson  they just pulled us out of the car put our hands behind out backs like we were criminals said landry s dance instructor emmanuel hurd  he asked me who is the girl she is my student i said i have a notarized letter from her parents stating that i have full guardianship over her while we are here landry thompson and the instructors said they pleaded with the police and told the police their story repeatedly it did not matter to the houston police landry thompson said they still put handcuffs on me and it really scared me and they put me in the back of the cop car i was terrified landry thompson was taken to protective services  i was horrified she was with the people i wanted her to be with she was with people who were safe who i knew would take care of her said her mother destiny thompson  yet they had taken her away from those people and now she was in a shelter wherever she was with people i didn t know protective services told destiny thompson that she would have to fly to houston to get her daughter after many phone calls with various officials landry thompson was released back into the custody of her dance instructors  i would love an apology said landry thompson s mother  they owe her an apology soon after the trio was back at the dance studio they intend to leave houston on monday afternoon the houston police hpd has not been responding to inquiries as to what happened were landry thompson and dance instructors victims of stereotyping and racism why did the houston police believe they had to react as they did does it have anything to do with the young dancer being a young white girl and the two dance instructors being young black males if the two instructors were white males would the police officers have reacted in the same manner the dance instructors had notarized document detailing that they were the young girl s guardian what else were they expected to do to ensure they would not be treated like common criminals but the productive human beings they are like my facebook page visit my

question or comment an alternative possibility is that a bipartisan group of senators could try to reach a deal on the filibuster themselves that way averting a confrontation that would further strain the already distrustful relationship between the two parties republicans have threatened to filibuster several obama appointees among them gina mccarthy the president s choice to lead the environmental protection agency on the ground that she was not forthcoming in responding to their written questions  they sent her nearly 1 100 the nomination of thomas e perez for labor secretary is in peril because republicans view his work as head of the justice department s civil rights division as too political they have vowed to block mr obama s pick to head the consumer financial protection bureau richard cordray because they object on principle to the existence of such a bureau and nominees to the national labor relations board are meeting similar obstacles  there may be some that we really have a fight over said senator lindsey graham republican of south carolina saying a drawn out argument over nominations could do considerable harm to the senate  so that s when we have to think this thing through he added saying he would support reopening talks with democrats over changing the rules on filibusters  if it becomes a problem and we get hung up over cabinet nominees yes i d be willing to there does appear to be one bright spot for the administration the nomination of penny pritzker as commerce secretary ms pritzker a chicago businesswoman who was a top fund raiser for mr obama appeared before the senate commerce committee on thursday and met little resistance from republicans but even a relatively gentle confirmation process for ms pritzker is unlikely to resolve the bigger differences between republicans and democrats republicans point out that they have approved the majority of mr obama s nominees but the new lengths to which they have gone to slow down confirmation including the first ever filibuster of a defense secretary nominee and requests that nominees respond to hundreds of written questions have made the process highly contentious senator mary landrieu democrat of louisiana said that after the senate voted on immigration changes she would support efforts to broker a compromise on the use of the filibuster president obama has invited the president of the delta sigma theta sorority to the white house for a tuesday afternoon meeting ending months of hope and speculation by leaders of the nation s largest african american sorority who have been gathered in washington this past week for their 100th anniversary celebration white house spokesman kevin lewis confirmed that obama will meet with cynthia butler mcintyre the conversation will come about two hours before an appearance at the convention by former secretary of state hillary rodham clinton who will speak during the second to last day of the convention which has brought more than 40 000 members to the district although sorority leaders said they are pleased that obama will meet with butler mcintyre many members had hoped that obama would visit one of the largest conventions in d c s history many members of the sorority expressed disappointment that neither the president nor first lady michelle obama would be making an official appearance on monday attorney general eric h holder jr spoke to the deltas in addition to talking about the recent supreme court ruling striking down parts of the voting rights act holder spoke about the shooting of trayvon martin and subsequent trial and acquittal of the shooter george zimmerman  they suffered a pain that no parent should endure holder said of martin s parents holder said the justice department has already launched an investigation as to whether or not martin s civil rights were violated the rev al sharpton and group of pastors from across the country held a news conference outside the justice department on monday to announce that florida will be the battleground for a new civil rights movement the deltas conference began last week and will continue through wednesday events have included a step show an ecumenical service a social action luncheon a gospel concert and the dedication of a stained glass window depicting african american women at howard university s andrew rankin memorial chapel washington one week after he released partial transcripts of interviews with irs officials involved in the scandal surrounding the targeting of conservative groups the chair of the house oversight and government reform committee said releasing the full transcripts would be reckless and irresponsible rep darrell issa r calif pushed back tuesday against calls to put out more information on the committee s investigation into the controversy sparked after a treasury department inspector general report revealed the irs had singled out tea party groups applying for nonprofit status for extra scrutiny responding specifically to criticism from rep elijah cummings d md  the ranking democratic member of the committee issa said that releasing full interviews conducted with irs employees would hurt the ongoing investigation  your decision to publicly announce that the investigation should wrap up was irresponsible but not surprising said issa in a letter to cummings  however your push to release entire transcripts from witness interviews while the investigation remains active was reckless and threatened to undermine the integrity of the committee s investigation the position is a tenuous one for issa who during an appearance on cnn s state of the union just over a week ago promised that the full transcripts would be released on that same program issa revealed several partial transcripts that suggested the directive to screen tea party groups came from officials in washington since then the huffington post has sent four emails asking issa s office when the full transcripts would be made public not one was returned when asked why issa s release of a partial transcript was fine but he opposed releasing the transcripts in full a spokesman for the congressman referred huffpost to another statement  limited releases of testimony may also serve to empower other witnesses to become whistleblowers and serve to vindicate individuals who have been subjected to criticism or retaliation at the hands of their managers said issa in that statement  on the other hand if a full transcript were released it would serve as a roadmap of the committee s investigation it could take weeks if not months to see the full transcripts should the committee wait to release them until the investigation is completed according to a democratic aide on the committee investigators have interviewed five irs employees so far and have 18 more to go in addition investigators are hoping to look through hundred of thousands of documents that could shed light on the tax agency s controversial screening practices unwilling to allow the partial transcripts issa released to be the only evidence in the public record cummings this week also released segments of interviews in a sunday memo to his colleagues on the oversight committee the congressman said that a manager in the irs cincinnati office who oversaw the nonprofit screening said that no one in washington ordered him to employ the practice of targeting tea party groups  although the committee interviewed a self identified conservative republican who denied any white house involvement or any political motivation for screening tea party cases chairman issa now appears to be going back on his promise to release the full interview transcripts of irs employees said cummings in a statement  chairman issa changes his mind so fast that even when i agree with him we re not on the same page i fully support responsible oversight but cherry picking transcript excerpts to fuel partisan and unsubstantiated claims is not a credible or effective way to investigate on tuesday an aide to cummings said the congressman would release the full transcripts of the already completed interviews by the end of the week if issa did not do so himself though the aide also cautioned that those plans could change the squabbling between the chairman and ranking member of the oversight committee has made the conversation surrounding the scandal far more contentious when news first broke that the irs had targeted conservative groups there was near bipartisan condemnation of the agency over time however politics has entered the debate and issa s handling of the committee s investigation has been criticized as a poorly disguised attempt to tie the issue to the president when issa called white house press secretary jay carney a paid liar earlier this month he was criticized publicly by democrats and privately by his own party more recently republicans have been more open in their concerns about where the investigation is heading rep charles boustany of louisiana a senior ways and means republican who chairs the panel s oversight subcommittee criticized issa s tactics saying the release of partial transcripts could adversely alter our ability to get future information from other irs employees just simply from a process standpoint you don t want to do that and alter what others might say boustany told politico  i really am concerned that it could tip this into the political realm rather than a true detailed investigation to get the facts out he added a lot of this has to be done quietly obviously as we piece together what has happened and once we piece it together and get the firm proof then you can come out and say what happened us representative michele bachmann speaks during the family research council frc action values voter summit on september 14 2012 at a hotel in washington dc the summit is an annual political conference for us social conservative activists and elected officials afp photo mandel ngan photo credit should read mandel ngan afp gettyimages rep michele bachmann r minn suggested sunday that the irs targeting of conservative groups during the 2012 presidential campaign undermines the election s credibility accusing president barack obama s administration of blatantly lying to the american people and questioning whether the agency would deny health care coverage for conservatives  we learned that during an election obama interfered with the first amendment rights of conservatives and tea party members by intimidating and harassing these organizations bachmann who unsuccessfully ran for the republican presidential nomination in 2012 said in an interview with conservative website world net daily  once again it appears the obama administration is blatantly lying to the american people people can right ask questions about the credibility of the elections on friday the irs admitted to engaging in inappropriate targeting of conservative political groups during the 2012 election agents singled out groups with tea party or patriot in their applications for tax exempt status as well as organizations that took issue with how the country is being run bachmann said agency claims that no high level officials were involved with developing the criteria for extra scrutiny are laughable  the obama administration wants us to believe low level functionaries are the ones responsible for making this decision she said  that is impossible laughable i can tell you within the irs the agency is very sensitive of jurisdictional authority the republican congresswoman pointed to the irs role in the implementation of obama s signature health care reform law as another potential area for concern claiming that it is reasonable to ask whether the agency will will deny or delay access to health care for conservatives  we learned to our horror in benghazi it appears that every move that was made was based on politics she said  now it appears the president was willing to use the most feared agency in the u s for his own political purposes  obama has a huge problem because obamacare relies very heavily on the irs gingrich said during a monday appearance on msnbc s morning joe  why would you trust the bureaucracy with your health if you can t trust the bureaucracy with your politics  the agency missed a feb 15 deadline to complete a review of the report which has 35 000 footnotes referring to 6 million documents from c i a files it now appears likely that the response offering the committee any factual corrections or broader judgments will be delayed until mr brennan s arrival because mr obama famously said he preferred to look forward not back at his predecessor s counterterrorism programs the senate report is by far the most thorough examination of how the united states came to use nudity cold sleep deprivation stress positions wall slamming and waterboarding methods it had long condemned as abuse or torture mr brennan will have to decide whether to support making a redacted version of the interrogation report public as the committee is likely to support after the c i a completes its review and as a united nations human rights adviser urged this week several democratic senators and at least one republican senator john mccain of arizona who was tortured as a prisoner in north vietnam have said that a declassified version must be released and mr brennan said he would give the request serious consideration he will have to decide whether to convene what the agency calls an accountability board to recommend punishment for current or former officials accused of mismanaging or misrepresenting the interrogation program if he tries to keep the peace by dismissing the dispute as history and a distraction from the agency s current challenges he will face strong resistance from the senate committee s democratic majority and mr mccain but emile a nakhleh a former top c i a analyst on political islam who once worked for him said mr brennan s work as mr obama s top counterterrorism adviser intimate knowledge of the agency and blunt style equip him well to handle the task  it will be challenging but if there s any person who can take this on it s brennan mr nakhleh said  he may say some harsh things about the program and some people won t like it but the institution will benefit labor secretary nominee thomas perez cut a secret deal behind closed doors with leaders of a minnesota city persuading them to drop a contentious lawsuit in exchange for the justice department staying out of whistleblower cases brought against the city according to a congressional republican report the quid pro quo according to the report potentially cost taxpayers as much as 200 million the allegations are highly unusual though are already being disputed by congressional democrats perez is not a favorite of congressional republicans and the charges could impact his pending confirmation hearing scheduled for this thursday the report obtained in advance by fox news claimed perez in february 2012 manipulated federal law as assistant attorney general and pushed the limits of justice to make this deal happen both cases involved the city of st paul the 67 page report states that the justice department s decision to opt out of the whistleblower cases potentially cost taxpayers as much as 200 million the amount the government could have won had it pursued damages in the case but according to the report the justice department stayed away from that case in order to get the city to drop an appeal to the supreme court on another matter the department was allegedly concerned that the high court in the course of reviewing that case would strike down a major element of civil rights enforcement  perez simply could not allow the court to rule the report said  perez sought leverage to stop the city from pressing its appeal the case the justice department was allegedly concerned about was st paul s appeal to the supreme court on a case in which property owners said the city made extraordinary efforts through strict code enforcement to condemn their properties the owners said reducing the amount of affordable housing for minorities violated the federal fair housing act by what is known as disparate impact perez appeared to think the supreme court overturning the case would have been a severe blow to civil rights enforcement the report concluded the disparate impact provision which the report described as legally questionable prohibits housing policies that end up discriminating against certain groups even if those policies are not blatantly discriminatory  perez sought facilitated and consummated this deal because he feared that the court would find disparate impact unsupported by the text of the fair housing act the report said the other end of the alleged deal was for the justice department not to get involved in cases against the city of st paul that alleged the city received millions in department of housing and urban development funds including stimulus money but failed to file the requisite paperwork regarding the hiring of low income workers in that case which also involved the city of minneapolis plaintiff thomas newell got neither the backing of the agency nor the justice department and lost the case which if won would likely have resulted in the cities repaying tens of millions in damages the obama administration has acknowledged that senior justice department attorneys recommended intervening in the case and characterized the false claims act infractions reported by newell as particularly egregious however they thought the case would be quite weak and never should have been a serious candidate for intervention according to the report the justice department claims everything was above board and that the department held three staff briefings heard 24 hours of additional testimony and reviewed 1 400 pages of documents before deciding not to intervene  the litigation decisions made by the department were in the best interests of the united states and were consistent with the department s legal ethical and professional responsibility obligations the department said in a statement former justice department spokeswoman tracy schmaler also questioned the use of the term quid pro quo to describe what happened  it s such a loaded term she said  i think in fact you have almost everybody agreeing nothing inappropriate happened the report subtitled how assistant attorney general thomas perez manipulated justice and ignored rule of law was a joint effort by minority leaders of the senate judiciary committee and the republican led house s judiciary and oversight and government reform committees  the facts surrounding this quid pro quo show that perez may have exceeded the scope of the ethics and professional responsibility opinions he received from the department and thereby violated his duties of loyalty and confidentiality to the united states perez also misled senior justice department officials about the quid pro quo the report states but congressional democrats put out a statement and memo of their own late sunday refuting the details the statement said the overwhelming evidence indicates perez and others acted professionally to advance the interests of civil rights and effectively combat the scourge of discrimination in housing they said the decision not to intervene in the suit against st paul was based on expert recommendations  instead of identifying inappropriate conduct by mr perez it appears that the accusations against him are part of a broader political campaign to undermine the legal safeguards against discrimination that mr perez was protecting they said washington dc july 31 speaker of the house john boehner r oh answers reporters questions during a brief news conference after the weekly house republican caucus meeting at the u s capitol july 31 2013 in washington dc boehner and other republican legislators have responded negatively to a grand bargain proposal to lower corporate tax rates in exchange for a boost in infrastructure spending and help for the middle class put forward by president barack obama who met with democratic lawmakers at the capitol today  photo by chip somodevilla getty images washington moderate democrats working to gather support from republicans for comprehensive immigration reform sent an ultimatum friday to speaker john boehner introduce a bill by sept 30 or they ll introduce their own  w e are frustrated that there was not a bipartisan immigration reform bill introduced prior to the august recess reads the letter from 39 members of the new democrat coalition a 53 member group including co chairmen reps joaquín castro d texas and jared polis d colo  therefore we write to inform you that if a bipartisan immigration reform package is not introduced in the house of representatives one that includes a pathway to citizenship helps grow american jobs and fixes our immigration system once and for all by september 30th we as new democrats will consider introducing a comprehensive immigration reform bill the letter continues read the letter here boehner an ohio republican has said he will not bring up any immigration bill particularly the one that passed the senate in june unless a majority of house republicans support it democrats and pro reform activists think they could get the 218 votes needed for passage of comprehensive immigration reform if boehner would allow for a vote by keeping most democrats and winning over some republicans members of congress leave town friday for the august recess a month long break during which they will hear from constituents meanwhile the clock is ticking closer to primaries and the 2014 election year democrats have said immigration reform should include a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants but many republicans have said it s a no go instead house republicans are pursuing a number of smaller bills such as border security legislation majority leader eric cantor r va and judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte r va are working on a bill to legalize undocumented young people who came to the u s as children but there aren t gop led efforts to deal with their parents a seven member bipartisan group in the house is working on comprehensive legislation with a path to citizenship though it has not yet come to a final agreement on legislative language the new democrat coalition letter says boehner can rely on its members for support if he brings up a bill with a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants  we have the support of the american people it concludes  we hope we can count on your support  abc cbs and nbc have so far refused to report the latest bombshell in the irs scandal a newly released list from the agency that showed it flagged political groups for anti obama rhetoric on september 18 usa today in a front page story reported the following newly uncovered irs documents vice president joe biden has apologized to president barack obama for putting him in a tough position that led to obama s announcement that he now supports same sex marriage senior administration officials said thursday obama said in an interview that aired thursday on abc that he made his decision public earlier than he had planned after biden s weekend remark that he was absolutely comfortable with letting gays and lesbians marry two senior administration officials said biden and obama met wednesday morning and biden apologized for putting obama in a tough spot obama responded by saying that he knew biden was speaking from the heart said the officials who didn t want to be named discussing private conversations between the president and vice president biden s remarks on nbc s meet the press on sunday launched a controversy that led to obama announcing that his position on same sex marriage which he had previously called evolving had shifted to support when obama s full interview aired thursday he said his disclosure came sooner than planned as a result of biden s comments  i had already made a decision that we were going to probably take this position before the election and before the convention obama said on abc s good morning america biden probably got out a little bit over his skis but out of generosity of spirit he said he added that he would have preferred to have done this in my own way on my own terms but all s well that ends well separately biden spokeswoman kendra barkoff said obama has been the leader on this issue from day one and the vice president never intended to distract from that once biden s comments drew attention to the issue obama made plans to announce his support next week on a previously scheduled appearance on the abc talk show the view a senior administration official said thursday the president and his advisers knew obama would be asked about the issue in the wake of biden s nbc interview said the official who didn t want to speak publicly about internal administration discussions ultimately they decided to move up the timeline and have him announce his support during the abc interview at the white house the official said and a top democrat told cnn that obama knew the issue would come up at the convention partly because of a push for support for same sex marriage to be included in the democratic party platform and in debates multiple top democrats told cnn the president s senior aides are annoyed with biden for forcing the conversation on same sex marriage now one source said biden has in the past counseled the president against coming out for same sex marriage making this move that much more frustrating but the sources said they don t believe it will create a lasting rift between the two leaders biden is known to go off script something obama knew when he selected his vice president in explaining to abc how his position has evolved obama noted that his daughters malia and sasha have friends whose parents are same sex couples it wouldn t dawn on them that somehow their friends parents would be treated differently and frankly that s the kind of thing that prompts a change of perspective not wanting to somehow explain to your child why somebody should be treated differently when it comes to the eyes of the law asked about whether his new position is a calculated move in an election year obama said it would be hard to argue that somehow this is something that i d be doing for political advantage because frankly you know the politics it s not clear how they cut the interview aired the same day obama attended a fundraiser in los angeles where support for same sex marriage is strong movie star george clooney hosted the event which is raking in 15 million according to a top democratic source and on monday openly gay singer ricky martin is hosting a fundraising event for obama in new york but some in the african american community have expressed strong disapproval of obama s endorsement of same sex marriage a democratic official said the white house has been actively reaching out to african american community leaders and pastors and will continue to do so in the wake of the president s decision but the official noted that even the president s base won t always agree with him on everything  there are going to be issues you don t agree on the official said and obama told abc he won t spend much time talking about the issue because he s focused on the economy the announcement puts obama squarely at odds with presumptive republican presidential nominee mitt romney who has since reiterated his opposition to same sex marriage  and i do not favor civil unions if they are identical to marriage other than by name romney said during a wednesday visit to fort lupton colorado  my view is the domestic partnership benefits hospital visitation rights and the like are appropriate but that the others are not the issue is a divisive one in american politics but it s uncertain how the development might play out at the voting booth a gallup poll released tuesday indicated 50 of americans believe same sex marriages should be recognized by law as valid with 48 saying such marriages should not be legal a dramatic shift from a few years ago a gallup poll in 2009 found 40 supported same sex marriage and 57 were opposed but a cnn orc international poll taken in late march indicated policies toward gays and lesbians were tied for last in people s opinions of the most important issues facing the country obama said he supports states deciding the issue on their own but added that he was disappointed by tuesday s vote on the issue in north carolina where a ban on same sex marriage was added to the constitution obama called the amendment discriminatory against gays and lesbians a spokesman said earlier wednesday six states massachusetts connecticut iowa vermont new hampshire and new york and the district of columbia issue marriage licenses to same sex couples while 31 states have voted in favor of constitutional amendments that seek to defend traditional definitions of marriage as a heterosexual union in february washington gov christine gregoire signed a bill that would legalize same sex marriage beginning in june but opponents there have pledged to block the bill and called for voters to decide the issue maryland gov martin o malley signed into law a bill that permits the state s same sex couples to wed as of january 1 and state residents may vote to affirm such a law minnesota will vote on a state constitutional amendment similar to the one in north carolina while maine will have a referendum on allowing same sex marriage meanwhile two cases seeking to overturn laws forbidding the practice one from california and another from massachusetts could be headed to the u s supreme court in coming months us secretary of state john kerry has said that in some cases us spying has gone too far mr kerry is the most senior obama administration official to have commented directly on an issue that has upset america s european allies he said he will work with the president to prevent further inappropriate acts by the national security agency his comments come as asian countries have protested at claims that australia was involved in a us led spy network china has demanded an explanation of the reports while indonesia has summoned the australian ambassador to jakarta  major technology companies including google apple and yahoo have called for the us government to do more to rein in the nsa s activities  a german mp said ex us intelligence contractor edward snowden is willing to travel to berlin to help investigations into the alleged surveillance of angela merkel s phone  indonesia s foreign minister said reports that the nsa used australian embassies to eavesdrop on asian countries would indicate a serious breach of diplomatic rules in his comments mr kerry also defended the need for increased surveillance saying it had thwarted terrorist attacks  we have actually prevented airplanes from going down buildings from being blown up and people from being assassinated because we ve been able to learn ahead of time of the plans mr kerry told a conference in london via video link  i assure you innocent people are not being abused in this process but there s an effort to try to gather information and yes in some cases it has reached too far inappropriately  and the president our president is determined to try to clarify and make clear for people and is now doing a thorough review in order that nobody will have the sense of abuse we are going to make sure that does not happen in the future he said mr kerry in his remarks to a conference organised by the open government partnership said that while some surveillance may have been excessive claims that up to 70 million were being monitored were an exaggeration claims about the extent of us surveillance of targets such as european leaders have strained washington s diplomatic relations with some of its key allies last week it was alleged that german chancellor angela merkel s mobile phone had been tapped for up to 10 years more recently there have been claims that the nsa hacked links connecting data centres operated by google and yahoo according to the sydney morning herald australia embassies in asia had been used to spy on asian countries such as china indonesia singapore thailand and vietnam  if confirmed such action is not only a breach of security but also a serious breach of diplomatic norms and ethics indonesian foreign minister marty natalegawa said the report describes a signals intelligence programme called stateroom which involves the interception of radio telecommunications and internet traffic using equipment in us british australian and canadian diplomatic missions australia s department of foreign affairs and trade declined to comment on the latest reports prime minister tony abbott said every australian governmental agency every australian official operates in accordance with the law the claims are the latest to emerge from documents leaked by ex us intelligence contractor edward snowden who has been granted temporary asylum in russia and is wanted in the us in connection with the unauthorised disclosures in germany a member of parliament has said mr snowden is willing to travel to berlin to help investigate allegations about the tapping of mrs merkel s phone hans christian stroebele who represents the opposition green party said there would need to be safeguards against mr snowden who he recently visited in moscow being deported to the united states the bbc s steve evans in berlin said germany s christian democrat led government may be unwilling to invite mr snowden to the country particularly as his presence would raise issues over extradition agreements with the united states in the wake of the claims about surveillance of online data centres six major technology companies have called for the us government to do more to control the nsa s activities the six called for appropriate oversight and accountability in a letter sent to a us senate committee sponsoring a bill designed to rein in the nsa aol apple facebook google microsoft and yahoo signed the letter to the senate committee on the judiciary saying the greater control would help to rebuild trust in government surveillance programs the internal revenue service s watchdog told top treasury officials around june 2012 he was investigating allegations the tax agency had targeted conservative groups for the first time indicating that obama administration officials were aware of the explosive matter in the midst of the president s re election campaign the disclosure to the treasury general counsel and the deputy secretary was a cursory one according to j russell george the treasury inspector general for tax administration he said he didn t reveal conclusions reuters edward snowden dropped out of high school tried army reserve training but quit after four months and then became a security guard now at age 29 snowden has become known worldwide as the man responsible for exposing vast surveillance programs by the national security agency one of the most secretive government agencies in the united states snowden stepped from the shadows and admitted that he had exposed the u s government s top secret surveillance programs to britain s guardian newspaper and the washington post after working in hawaii for a company under contract to the nsa americans are debating whether he is a patriotic defender of civil liberties or the most unprincipled of traitors snowden saw his role more clearly saying the u s government s powers of surveillance have grown so immense and intrusive that he felt compelled to denounce them even at great personal cost he could have remained anonymous but said his message would resonate more powerfully if he revealed his identity  the public needs to decide whether these programs and policies are right or wrong snowden told the guardian in the 12 minute video introducing him to the world on sunday abandoning his life in hawaii last month snowden went into hiding in hong kong saying he feared he could be captured by the cia another foreign government or asian organized crime gangs  that s a fear i ll live under for the rest of my life however long that happens to be he said in the video in his secretive dealings with the washington post he took the codename verax latin to describe a truth teller the paper said  he s very intelligent calm but always scared that someone would knock on the door and he d be taken away said ewen macaskill one of the guardian journalists who worked on the story snowden expressed some interest in seeking asylum in iceland he checked out of his hotel in hong kong on monday and his whereabouts were not known in recent years he had returned to the washington suburbs of his youth before taking his final assignment in hawaii  he was quiet shy always walked around with his head down said joyce kinsey a neighbor in ellicott city maryland who said snowden moved into an apartment there about three years ago and that his mother soon followed he later moved to hawaii  they are a nice family i feel really really sorry for his mother she always left her curtains open and you could see right in but now since all these reporters showed up she s keeping the curtains closed this whole neighborhood is shocked little from snowden s childhood could portend his future place alongside daniel ellsberg who disclosed the so called pentagon papers during the vietnam war and bradley manning the u s army private on military trial for providing wikileaks with documents as one of the most important leakers of u s secrets as a youth in the washington suburb of fort meade maryland snowden attended local schools but dropped out of arundel high school about halfway through his sophomore year said school spokesman bob mosier snowden s parents divorced when he was 18 and they lived in crofton maryland a planned community where many nsa employees and their families live snowden told the guardian he joined the military with the idea of aiding the u s war effort in iraq and to help free people from oppression he lasted only four months after breaking both legs in a training exercise he said pentagon records show he enlisted in the army reserve as a special forces recruit entering in may 2004 and leaving four months later without completing his training later he landed his first job at the university of maryland working at a covert nsa facility near the campus snowden said he then went to the cia in information technology security rising quickly because of his understanding of the internet and his computer programming skills he told the guardian by 2007 the cia had stationed him with diplomatic cover in geneva switzerland where he maintained computer network security he told the guardian his experience there and working alongside cia officers gradually led him to question his own role in the government with time snowden told the guardian he could no longer live unfreely but comfortably as a well paid infrastructure analyst for booz allen hamilton a company hired by the nsa to manage its surveillance system he said he was willing to accept any risk by revealing top secrets and left his live in girlfriend behind snowden s parents and sisters did not return phone calls or emails nor did a 28 year old woman named lindsay a mills who lived at the same address with him in maryland and hawaii  for those of you that know me without my superhero cape you can probably understand why i ll be refraining from blog posts for a while mills a dancer wrote in a blog post on monday  at the moment all i can feel is alone and for the first time in my life i feel strong enough to be on my own among the telling details on the public record was snowden s support for ron paul the libertarian u s politician who has run unsuccessfully for the republican party s presidential nomination campaign finance records showed snowden twice donated 250 to paul s 2012 campaign which was based largely on the principle that government has grown too meddlesome and intruded on personal freedom with little more information than that sympathizers portrayed snowden as a hero a fund started on the online fundraising platform crowdtilt had raised more than 8 100 by monday afternoon saying the cash would support snowden for any expenses such as hotels and airfare separately the progressive change campaign committee said it was raising money for his legal defense an online petition asking the white house to pardon snowden accumulated some 26 550 signatures there was an angry backlash as well some denounced him as a anti american spy one u s counterterrorism official was worried by reports that snowden handled or had access to cia and nsa communications in geneva and japan two vital listening posts  he might be young but this is not exactly a low level guy he s privy to a lot what scares me is what else he knows and if the chinese will get to him said the official who is regularly briefed on reports under the foreign intelligence surveillance act and spoke on condition of anonymity the official noted that the information snowden leaked was top secret compared to lower level secret information that manning admitted he provided to wikileaks  so this is a lot more damaging the official said washington reuters the internal revenue service official at the center of a scandal about extra tax scrutiny of conservative groups told congress on wednesday she had done nothing wrong but invoked her constitutional right not to answer questions lois lerner who heads the irs tax exempt unit angered lawmakers by reading a statement before refusing to testify but she was dismissed from the hearing with a warning that she could be called back for another appearance before the house oversight and government reform committee  i have not done anything wrong i have not broken any laws i have not violated any irs rules or regulations and i have not provided false information to this or any congressional committee lerner told the panel  because i am asserting my right not to testify i know that some people will assume that i have done something wrong i have not she said house oversight chairman darrell issa a california republican said lerner appeared to have waived her right against self incrimination by making the statement republican trey gowdy of south carolina demanded that she stay to answer questions drawing applause from the crowd in the hearing room after conferring with aides issa who has accused lerner of providing false or misleading information to congress last year about the irs s treatment of conservative groups seeking tax exempt status dismissed her from the hearing but said he might call her to testify in the future photographers swarmed lerner as she left lerner is at the center of a political scandal over the tax collection agency s use of search terms such as tea party and patriots to select groups for additional scrutiny of their qualifications for tax exempt status the tax agency s inappropriate targeting of conservative groups as described in a treasury inspector general report released last week has set off a political firestorm and led republicans to question whether democratic president barack obama s administration was involved the scandal along with others involving questions about the justice department s tracking of reporters in investigations into national security leaks and an ongoing probe about the administration s response to the deadly attack on the u s mission in benghazi libya in september threatens to undercut obama s second term agenda the president is trying to negotiate a budget deal with republicans and push a comprehensive immigration reform bill through congress congressional investigators have said lerner was the washington official who learned in june 2011 that workers in a cincinnati ohio office were using inappropriate criteria and ordered them changed issa and other lawmakers have complained that lerner and other irs officials knew of targeting by the irs but did not inform congress lerner made the irs targeting public on may 10 sparking investigations by three congressional committees and a criminal probe by the department of justice her refusal to testify on wednesday stymied attempts by issa s panel to learn who was responsible for initiating the targeting and supervising the targeting at the hearing frustrated lawmakers repeatedly criticized former irs commissioner douglas shulman and j russell george who published a watchdog report on the practice last week for not alerting congress to the practice earlier democratic representative stephen lynch of massachusetts warned their failure to be more forthcoming could require the appointment of a special prosecutor to look into the scandal issa said an irs internal review uncovered the policy of scrutinizing conservative groups in may 2012 and that top officials including outgoing acting irs commissioner steven miller were made aware of the findings but did not alert congress for nearly a year he also questioned why george s investigators looking into the targeting allowed irs officials to be present during investigative interviews with subordinates and criticized the inspector general for waiting 10 months to give the committee information on the targeting george said it would have been impractical for us to give you partial information that may not be accurate shulman repeated the testimony he gave a senate hearing on tuesday that he did not know the full details of the targeting for two years after it started in 2010 issa told shulman if you didn t know you were derelict in your duty representative elijah cummings of maryland the ranking democrat on the panel criticized shulman for not alerting congress to the practice after testifying in march 2012 without mentioning it he said it would have been common sense to come back even if it were a phone call or a letter issa said the employees in the irs tax exempt unit could have and should have been a whistleblower on the targeting shulman said he never discussed the targeting with anyone at the white house republican representative jim jordan of ohio noted that shulman visited the white house 118 times during 2010 and 2011 and said it was surprising the issue would not have come up shulman said he mostly talked about budget and tax issues with the healthcare overhaul another frequent topic washington congressional republicans not resting with the internal revenue service scandal are moving to broaden the matter to an array of tax malfeasances and intimidation tactics they hope will ensnare the white house republican charges range from clearly questionable actions to seemingly specious allegations and they grow by the day on friday lawmakers sought to tie the i r s matter to the carrying out of president obama s health care law which will rely heavily on the agency whether they succeed holds significant ramifications for mr obama who will soon know if he is dealing with a late spring thunderstorm that may soon blow over or a consuming squall that will leave lasting damage representative dave camp republican of michigan the usually mild mannered chairman of the house ways and means committee set the tone friday at congress s first hearing on the targeting of conservative groups by the i r s laying out details from the alleged threatening of donors to conservative nonprofit groups to the leaking of confidential i r s documents in that context he said the screening of tea party groups for special scrutiny was not the scandal itself but just the latest example of a culture of cover ups and political intimidation in this administration at various points over the past two years internal revenue service officials singled out for scrutiny not only groups with tea party or patriot in their names but also nonprofit groups that criticized the government and sought to educate americans about the u s constitution according to documents in an audit conducted by the agency s inspector general the documents obtained by the washington post from a congressional aide with knowledge of the findings show that the irs field office in charge of evaluating applications for tax exempt status decided to focus on groups making statements that criticize how the country is being run and those that were involved in educating americans on the constitution and bill of rights the staffers in the cincinnati field office were making high level decisions on how to evaluate the groups because a decade ago the irs assigned all applications to that unit the irs also eliminated an automatic after the fact review process washington used to conduct such determinations marcus owens who oversaw tax exempt groups at the irs between 1990 and 1999 said that delegation carries with it a risk because the cincinnati office isn t as plugged into what s politically sensitive as washington owens now with the firm caplin drysdale said that before the agency s most recent reorganization it had a series of tripwires in place that could catch unfair targeting including the fact that the irs identified its criteria for special scrutiny in a public manual  there s no longer that safety valve and as a result the irs has been rolling the dice ever since said owens who worked at the agency for nearly a quarter century and now represents some organizations seeking tax exempt status the irs came under withering attack from gop lawmakers sunday sen susan collins of maine a moderate republican described the practice as absolutely chilling and called on president obama to condemn the effort  this is truly outrageous she said on cnn s state of the union adding that even though white house spokesman jay carney has said the matter deserves an investigation the president needs to make crystal clear that this is totally unacceptable in america in march 2012 then irs commissioner douglas h shulman who was appointed by president george w bush told congress that the agency was not targeting conservative groups on sunday the agency declined to answer questions about whether senior officials asked irs exempt organizations division chief lois g lerner and her staff in cincinnati about this heightened scrutiny before testifying it did not take place  there has to be accountability for the people who did it house oversight and government reform committee chairman darrell issa r calif said on nbc s meet the press adding and quite frankly up until a few days ago there s got to be accountability for people who were telling lies about it being done the appendix of the inspector general s report which was requested by the house oversight and government reform committee and has yet to be publicly released chronicles the extent to which the irs s exempt organizations division kept redefining what sort of social welfare groups it should single out for extra attention since the 2010 supreme court ruling citizens united v federal election commission that decision allowed corporations and labor unions to raise and spend unlimited sums on elections as well as register for tax exempt status under section 501 c 4 of the tax code as long as their primary purpose was not targeting electoral candidates the number of political groups applying for tax exempt status more than doubled in the wake of the citizens united ruling forcing agency officials to make a slew of determinations despite uncertainty about the category s ambiguous definition of the 298 groups selected for special scrutiny according to the congressional aide 72 had tea party in their title 13 had patriot and 11 had 9 12 lerner who apologized friday for the targeting of such groups described it as a misguided effort to deal with a flood of applications for tax exempt status she did not release the names of the groups on june 29 2011 according to the documents irs staffers held a briefing with lerner in which they described giving special attention to instances where statements in the case file criticize how the country is being run she raised an objection and the agency adopted a more general set of standards lerner who is a democrat is not a political appointee but six months later the irs applied a new political test to social welfare groups the document says on jan 15 2012 the agency decided to look at political action type organizations involved in limiting expanding government educating on the constitution and bill of rights social economic reform movement according to the appendix in the ig s report the agency did not appear to adopt a more neutral test for 501 c 4 groups until may 17 2012 according to the timeline in the report at that point the irs again updated its criteria to focus on organizations with indicators of significant amounts of political campaign intervention raising questions as to exempt purpose and or excess private benefit  campaign reform groups have been pressing the irs for several years to conduct greater oversight of nonprofits formed in the wake of the citizens united case given that many have become heavily involved in elections  but this isn t the type of enforcement we want said paul ryan a senior counsel at the campaign legal center  we want nonpartisan non biased enforcement loyola law school professor ellen aprill who specializes in tax law said any groups that have applied for tax exempt status has opened themselves up to scrutiny by the irs  it s part of their job to look for organizations that may be more likely to have too much campaign intervention she said  but it is important to try to make these criteria as politically neutral as possible aprill said one of the problems is the agency s top officials have not provided clear enough guidelines on what constitutes too much political activity for a social welfare group because it s been a hot potato and that now with this new controversy it s going to make it even more difficult to do so toby marie walker president of the waco tea party said the irs subjected her group to a series of unreasonable requests after it applied for tax exempt status in june 2010 the requests came in early 2012 walker said after being initially informed by an official in the cincinnati field office that he was sitting on a stack of tea party applications and they were awaiting word from higher ups as to how to process them the agency asked the group s treasurer to supply information on its close relationship with current candidates and elected officials as well as future candidates along with detailed information about its contributors and members it also asked for transcripts of any radio interviews its officials had done and hard copies of any news articles mentioning them  that would take me years to do walker said noting that in some cases chinese media outlets referred to her organization  am i responsible for every news article across the globe the group had even more difficulty providing transcripts and details of speakers at its events since they hosted informal gatherings such as rant contests where anyone could come and express their views while the irs awarded the waco tea party tax exempt status about six weeks ago walker said the group was now considering suing the agency since the process not only consumed time and effort but prompted the group to scale back its 2012 get out the vote operation  we were afraid to do it and get in trouble she said sal russo chief strategist for the tea party express said that even though the agency s actions intimidated tea party adherents he gives the irs credit for standing up and admitting it targeted them and while only two of the agency s officials the commissioner and the chief counsel are political appointees russo said the administration needs to conduct better oversight  the culture is set at the top russo said  obviously you can t control what every employee does but you have to set a standard particularly with the irs to be squeaky clean josh hicks and julie tate contributed to this report discuss this topic and other political issues in the politics discussion forums the controversy over internal revenue service targeting of politically active groups continues to deepen in the latest twist congressional democrats are stepping up their charge that the investigation so far has focused too much on conservative groups and ignored targeting of liberal and progressive groups democrats in a letter to republicans point to new evidence that progressive groups were being scrutinized that includes a powerpoint presentation from the cincinnati office where the review occurred and a newly discovered watch list the new evidence suggests irs workers in cincinnati were actively scrutinizing liberal groups as well as conservative ones the cincinnati office reviews all applications for tax exempt status over the past month the white house has battled four different controversies which have stung president barack obama knocked him off message and taken a toll on americans trust in their institutions but according to the evidence so far only one of them goes all the way to the top to the president himself complaints about the national security agency s secret surveillance programs ironically many of the president s chief republican critics have embraced those programs which could make it harder for the gop in the long term to score political points on the issue  i believe we should be listening to terrorists known terrorist emails following their emails and following their phone calls sen lindsey graham r s c said recently  we need this program at the same time however the revelation of these programs has angered republican leaning libertarians as well as some liberal democrats who are themselves part of the president s base  i don t think collecting millions and millions of americans phone calls now this is the metadata this is time place to whom you direct the calls is making us any safer sen mark udall d colo said on nbc s meet the press for his part obama has embraced a national debate of these programs even if that conversation wouldn t have existed without the leak of these secret programs to the news media  we do have to strike a balance and we do have to be cautious about how our governments are operating when it comes to intelligence he said on wednesday at a news conference with germany chancellor angela merkel  and so this is a debate that i welcome no evidence yet that irs benghazi and leak investigations go to the top by comparison the other three controversies concerning the irs the drafting of talking points on the terrorist attack in benghazi and leak investigations involving journalists have yet to show a direct tie to the president or wrongdoing among his top political advisers despite republican efforts to prove otherwise in fact rep elijah cummings d md the ranking member of the house oversight and government reform committee released testimony on tuesday from a cincinnati based irs front line manager who appeared to dismiss the idea that the white house played a role in the agency s targeting of conservative sounding groups applying for tax exempt status from the transcript of congressional investigators interview with this irs employee john shafer who described himself as a conservative republican rep darrell issa r calif chairman of the house oversight committee howled at the release of the testimony  i am deeply disappointed that ranking member cummings has decided to broadly disseminate and post online a 205 page transcript that will serve as a roadmap for irs officials to navigate investigative interviews with congress he said republicans also point to the irs employee s testimony that his answers no reason to believe that meant no personal knowledge but shafer s testimony confirmed the finding from the inspector general s report on the irs controversy which concluded that the targeting wasn t influenced by any individual or organization outside the irs meanwhile when it comes to the drafting of talking points after the terrorist attack in benghazi libya congressional republicans now have focused more on former secretary of state hillary clinton and her state department especially after the white house released the actual emails developing those talking points and the leak investigations involving journalists point to the justice department not the white house  the president and white house have been cabined off from any wrongdoing here a white house official tells first read  and nothing in the facts so far contradicts that but that doesn t exonerate white house aides from making a series of missteps in handling these controversies whether it was not being initially forthcoming about when it knew about the inspector general s report into the irs targeting or suggesting that a single adjustment was made to the benghazi talking points when more than one was made gop there is still information we need while a top republican house aide admits that it s very possible the irs benghazi and leak investigation controversies don t go all the way up to the president the aide says there is still information we need let the facts take us where they will the aide adds the gop aide goes on to say that the republican party s goal with these investigations has never been to get an immediate touchdown  we are content to get three yards on a play here is a status update on the four controversies over the past month irs on may 10 irs official lois lerner a civil servant revealed that the agency had targeted conservative sounding groups applying for tax exempt status an inspector general s report confirmed that finding but it also concluded that the targeting wasn t influenced by any individual or organization outside the irs after the revelation acting irs commissioner steven miller announced his resignation obama appointed top budget official danny werfel to head the agency and lerner was placed on administrative leave after invoking the 5th amendment to a congressional committee more recently rep issa s house oversight and government reform committee released partial testimony from cincinnati based irs employees contending that washington officials played a role in the targeting but those washington officials have never been tied to the obama white house or its political team what s more ranking member cummings released testimony showing a conservative irs employee declaring that the white house had no role in the targeting benghazi on the same day that lerner first said the irs had targeted conservative sounding groups abc news reported on edits that the state department and obama administration had made to the talking points describing the sept 11 2012 attack on the u s diplomatic outpost in benghazi libya the edits included removing references to ansar al sharia to not hinder the investigation into the attack and changing a reference to the benghazi location as a mission or diplomatic post rather than a consulate but when the white house released the actual emails they revealed more agency politics between the state department and cia than electoral politics which republican critics had alleged in fact the emails showed white house deputy national security adviser ben rhodes urging his colleagues to ensure they had the right information  there is a ton of wrong information getting out into the public domain from congress and people who are not particularly informed rhodes wrote  insofar as we have firmed up assessments that don t compromise intel or the investigation we need to have the capability to correct the record as there are significant policy and messaging ramifications that would flow from a hardened mis impression republicans however pointed their finger at the state department for wanting to change the talking points  the seemingly political nature of the state department s concerns raises questions about the motivations behind these changes and who at the state department was seeking them said a spokesman for republican house speaker john boehner leak investigations after the irs and benghazi stories surfaced last month the associated press revealed that the justice department secretly obtained phone records of ap reporters and editors in pursuing a national security leak then another story dropped the justice department labeled a fox news reporter as a co conspirator in a separate leak case after criticism of the justice department s actions president obama called for congress to pass a media shield law and he also instructed the justice department to conduct a review of guidelines about investigations regarding reporters due to the president by july 12  journalists should not be at legal risk for doing their jobs obama said in his national security speech last month  our focus must be on those who break the law nsa surveillance on june 5 glenn greenwald of the guardian newspaper reported that the u s government has collected american s phone records and other meta data and the government later revealed it was part of a national security agency program dating back to 2006 the guardian and washington post later reported on a different surveillance program that gathers foreign intelligence through information from electronic sources including major internet companies obama has argued these programs have checks and balances  this is not a situation in which we are rifling through the ordinary emails of german citizens or american citizens or french citizens or anybody else he said at his news conference on wednesday  this is a circumscribed narrow system directed at us being able to protect our people and all of it is done under the oversight of the courts earlier in the week national security officials testified that the programs helped prevent numerous potential terrorist events this story was originally published oninternal revenue service documents showing that the agency might have scrutinized politically liberal groups before it inappropriately targeted conservative ones intensified debate on capitol hill last week leaving the agency and its watchdog scrambling to explain themselves the result may be an already embattled irs that faces even more criticism and an inspector general risking a compromised reputation j russell george s may report about the irs s treatment of conservative groups led to public outrage agency apologies congressional hearings a justice department probe and several dismissals including the forced resignation of acting commissioner steven miller by the white house but democrats are now questioning the treasury inspector general s audit in light of the new irs documents which show that terms such as progressive health care legislation and medical marijuana appeared on a multipart be on the lookout list or bolo that helped agents determine which groups deserved additional screening in a june 26 letter to the inspector general rep sander m levin d mich said there is increasing evidence that the may 14 2013 audit was fundamentally flawed and that your handling of it has failed to meet the necessary test of objectivity and forthrightness george s spokeswoman karen kraushaar fueled that notion when she told the hill newspaper that the office of house oversight and government reform committee chairman rep darrell issa r calif asked the inspector general to narrowly focus on tea party organizations issa s office has denied it made such a request kraushaar has walked back her remarks telling the washington post the statements attributed to me in the hill are not accurate she did not say the article misquoted her  several members of congress shared their concerns about tea party organizations with the inspector general s office kraushaar said in an e mail  however the focus of our audit was on the irs s consistency in its identification and review of applications for tax exempt status involving potential political advocacy issues george appointed to his position in 2006 by president george w bush said in a letter to levin that his office reviewed all cases that the irs identified as potential political cases and did not limit our audit to allegations related to the tea party the inspector general testified before congress last month that his office was unable to determine whether any cases in the audit involved progressive groups he said the names in many instances were neutral in that you couldn t necessarily attribute it to one particular affiliation or another rep gerald e connolly d va whose questioning prompted that response said in a recent letter to george that his testimony was at best incomplete if not misleading he also suggested that george should appear again before the house oversight committee to explain himself there is little doubt that the irs erred in its review of tax exemption applications acting irs commissioner daniel werfel whom president obama appointed to lead the agency after miller s resignation said in a conference call with reporters last week that the screening methods were inappropriate but werfel added his agency s 30 day internal review had not found evidence of intentional wrongdoing by anyone in the irs or involvement in these matters by anyone outside the irs the bolo could still be problematic for the irs the list s emerging issues category included only conservative associated terms at the outset raising questions about why the irs prioritized conservative groups but not those from the political left the term progressive appeared in a separate part of the bolo and questions remain about when and how that term was used as well as whether those separate bolo categories were even relevant to the audit the irs and george s office have said they re still looking into those matters the bolo also directed agents to flag tea party cases for further review while allowing processors to approve other types of groups on merit if applicable george s audit focused primarily on the emerging issues category as part of an effort to help identify groups involved in possible campaign intervention something that can potentially disqualify an organization from tax exempt status george has said the irs did not use progressive criteria to identify groups involved in campaign intervention  we are reviewing whether these criteria led to expanded scrutiny for other reasons and why these criteria were implemented his office said in a statement last week republicans have downplayed the recent revelations about progressive search criteria  our democratic colleagues should stop trying to derail the investigation by defending irs officials with distorted claims equating the systematic scrutiny of tea party groups with the more routine screening progressive groups received issa said house ways and means committee chairman dave camp r mich said the irs controversy goes beyond the issue of search terms to the inappropriate questions agents asked of conservative groups and alleged leaks of private taxpayer information  at this point the evidence shows us that conservative groups were not only flagged but targeted and abused by the irs said camp spokeswoman sarah swinehart  as we gather the facts we will follow them wherever they lead us washington house speaker john boehner r ohio suggested wednesday that government officials might deserve prison time as a result of the internal revenue service s scrutiny of conservative groups  my question isn t about who s going to resign my question is who s going to jail over this scandal mr boehner said at a press conference wednesday lawmakers in both parties have pushed for more information after the irs apologized last week for what it said was inappropriate scrutiny of tax exemption requests by conservative groups with tea party or patriot in their names rove said liberal organizations had first exploited the loophole which has garnered attention in the wake of news the irs scrutinized applications for tax exempt status from small tea party groups  501 c 4s have been around for a long time and the democrats and the left have used these for years to do some politics and a lot of social welfare rove said on fox news sunday listing the naacp the sierra club and planned parenthood as groups that serve a social welfare function and still engage in political activity  you have to spend a majority of your money on social welfare and a minority of your resources on political activity rove a career political strategist raised hundreds of millions of dollars during the 2012 election and spent them on political advertisements designed to influence the presidential and congressional races rove s crossroads gps is one of hundreds of essentially political organizations that receive tax exempt status designed for social welfare groups while many have called for reforms to the law allowing such groups to receive tax breaks rove insisted that the exemption is justified and that organizations that support the democratic party have been working the statute longer  what happened is the democrats had this for decades for literally decades and no criticism at all then republicans began in 2010 to say wait a minute if it s good enough for them we ll duplicate that structure as well then suddenly we get what we get which is a huge bunch of activity aimed at conservative groups the bush administration probed the naacp s tax exempt status between 2004 and 2006 and ultimately allowed the group to maintain its classification rove s organizations do not provide the counseling legal

of the national security agency s collection of americans telephone records thursday as snowballing concerns made new limitations on the intelligence effort appear increasingly likely obama and vice president joe biden joined lawmakers on both sides of the issue for an oval office meeting designed to stem the bleeding of public support and show obama was serious about engaging among the participants were the nsa s most vigorous congressional supporters the top democrats and republicans in the house and senate intelligence panels alongside its most stern critics including democratic sens ron wyden of oregon and mark udall of colorado the lawmakers departed the rainy white house grounds without speaking to reporters but in interviews later they said there was a consensus that the surveillance efforts are suffering from perception problems that have undercut trust among the american people  there is openness to making changes said rep c a  dutch ruppersberger of maryland the top democrat on the house intelligence committee sen saxby chambliss of georgia top republican on the senate s intelligence panel and a strong nsa defender said obama and the lawmakers didn t agree to take specific steps but brought up a number of proposals that will be fleshed out over the august congressional recess  a lot of ideas were thrown out chambliss told the associated press  nothing was concluded wyden in an interview said he and udall had sought to convince obama of the urgency of addressing rising concerns he said he proposed strengthening the government s ability to get emergency authorization to collect an individual s phone records so that pre emptive collection of everyone s records would no longer be necessary  i felt that the president was open to ideas and we re going to make sure he has some wyden said after returning to capitol hill wyden and two senate colleagues also unveiled legislation thursday to overhaul the secret federal court that oversees the programs which critics decry as largely a rubber stamp the senators aim to make the court created under the foreign intelligence surveillance act or fisa more adversarial by creating a special advocate who could argue for privacy during closed door proceedings and appeal decisions a companion bill would diversify the court s bench by ending the chief justice s sole authority to pick its judges  these bills do not compromise national security but they put a necessary opposing view in the fisa court and assure ideological diversity of judges said sen tom udall d n m another of the bill s sponsors sen richard blumenthal d conn said the obama administration was receptive to the ideas although white house officials declined to comment debate over the line between counterterrorism and invasion of privacy has been heating up since former government contract systems analyst edward snowden leaked classified documents exposing the nsa s monumental capability to sweep up data about phone and internet use including programs that store years of phone records on virtually every american snowden s revelations have prompted a national rethinking over government surveillance powers that have grown since the sept 11 2001 terrorist attacks russia decided on thursday to grant temporary asylum to snowden who has been in a moscow airport hotel for more than a month despite america s insistence that the fugitive be sent home to face prosecution on espionage charges in washington house judiciary committee chairman bob goodlatte r va said he stressed to obama the role congress must play in ensuring that u s spying isn t infringing on congress intent or on civil liberties he said his committee would further probe the issue including in a classified hearing he s hoping to hold in september extending its efforts to defend the programs to the public the white house pledged to help americans understand as much as possible about how they work even as it staunchly defended their efficacy in keeping a post 9 11 america safe  that process will continue said white house spokesman jay carney  but i don t think that we can sensibly say that programs designed to protect us from terrorist attack are not necessary in this day and age the more information about the programs the government has released the more it has fed even greater concerns about the scope of the surveillance and whether obama s national security team has been truthful in describing it publicly in the past after the administration on wednesday declassified more documents about an email mining program wyden said they showed the government had repeatedly made inaccurate statements to congress about the effectiveness in countering terrorism and new details released about the phone records program created new fodder for critics by confirming for the first time that when investigating one suspected terrorist the government can also examine records of people who called people who called the targeted individual netting millions of people s records in a single request meanwhile the head of the nsa openly clashed with lawmakers including sen patrick leahy d vt over the agency s statements that telephone and email data collection helped foil 54 terror plots rising tensions have stoked concern at the white house that surveillance programs obama considers crucial will soon be undermined or even dismantled despite the fact that many democrats and republicans in congress have come to the nsa s defense leahy the judiciary committee chairman has threatened to seek to end the phone records program if it s not proven effective and sen jeff merkley d ore signaled thursday that unless an agreement is reached on releasing more of the secret court s opinions he would push congress to use its power of the purse to compel their disclosure by withholding funding for certain programs even some staunch advocates for a tough national security stance have become outspoken critics including rep jim sensenbrenner r wis who helped write the usa patriot act but now says the phone records collection goes far beyond what he envisioned and may not be renewed sensenbrenner was among the lawmakers who shared concerns in the session thursday with obama and top officials including biden national security advisory susan rice and white house counsel kathryn ruemmler the white house also was spooked by a house vote last week to dismantle the program which failed by a narrow 217 205 margin associated press writer richard lardner contributed to this report washington attorney general eric holder said tuesday the justice department has opened a criminal probe of the internal revenue service s treatment of tea party groups while an investigative report blamed the agency s managers for allowing the practices to continue for more than 18 months on tuesday night president barack obama termed the audit findings intolerable and inexcusable and said he directed treasury secretary jacob lew to hold those responsible accountable the internal revenue service s scrutiny of conservative groups went beyond those with tea party or patriot in their names as the agency admitted friday to also include ones worried about government spending debt or taxes and even ones that lobbied to make america a better place to live according to new details of a government probe the investigation also revealed that a high ranking irs official knew as early as mid 2011 that conservative groups were being inappropriately targeted nearly washington an evangelical minister who was asked to give the benediction at president obama s inauguration ceremony pulled out of the event thursday after a controversy about comments he made against homosexuality in the 1990s on tuesday the presidential inaugural committee announced that it had invited the rev louie giglio head pastor of passion city church in atlanta to participate in the jan 21 ceremony soon afterward the liberal website thinkprogress posted excerpts and an audio file of a sermon giglio gave in the mid 1990s in which he criticizes homosexuality as profoundly antithetical to christianity  you come to only one conclusion homosexuality is less than god s best for his creation giglio said in the sermon  it is less than god s best for us and everything in our lives that is less than god s best for us and his plan for us and his design for us is sin that s god s voice after having courted the gay and lesbian community during his first term with efforts like the elimination of the military s don t ask don t tell policy the president s inclusion of giglio 54 in the inauguration quickly proved awkward the obama administration is already fending off criticism from some on the left over negative remarks made by secretary of defense nominee chuck hagel in 1998 about a gay diplomat no one answered the phone thursday at passion city church whose ministry focuses on young people but on the church s website giglio wrote that after discussions between his team and the administration he had decided to withdraw from the inauguration so as not to become a distraction  the issue of homosexuality which a particular message of mine some 20 years ago addressed is one of the most difficult our nation will navigate giglio wrote  however individuals rights of freedom and the collective right to hold differing views on any subject is a critical balance we as a people must recover and preserve typically clergy members asked to participate in presidential events undergo rigorous vetting but mistakes occasionally occur said john green director of the ray c bliss institute of applied politics at the university of akron the obama inauguration committee appeared to acknowledge the slip  we were not aware of pastor giglio s past comments at the time of his selection and they don t reflect our desire to celebrate the strength and diversity of our country at this inaugural said spokeswoman addie whisenant  pastor giglio was asked to deliver the benediction in large part for his leadership in combating human trafficking around the world gay rights activists praised giglio s departure evangelical groups condemned it a rising star in the evangelical community giglio did not disavow the sermon which represents the way many conservative christians view homosexuality for the last two decades american christianity has been divided sometimes acrimoniously over growing societal acceptance of gays and lesbians and what certain old testament verses say about same sex interactions the country s increased religious diversity green said can make choosing clergy for an event like the inauguration exceedingly delicate  the symbolism is very important when clergy are involved in a presidential ceremony green said  different kinds of clergy are invited to show that the president has support from and supports the religious diversity of america you have to assemble a good program now that might not offend somebody but because we have faith based disagreements in america that s not easy to do on wednesday president barack obama said treasury secretary jack lew asked for and accepted the resignation of the acting internal revenue service irs commissioner steven t miller however miller s term as acting irs commissioner was up in a couple of weeks and it is presently unclear whether he was forced to resign or was simply granting notice that his term was up obama will face reporters on thursday to answer questions about the irs scandal that placed nearly 500 conservative organizations in the irs s crosshairs during the 2010 and 2012 elections beyond the classic question what did the administration know and when did it know it a myriad of questions remain unanswered here are just a few who inside the irs hatched the plan to target conservatives and what if any connections do they their associates or superiors have to the obama white house campaign team or other political organizations  who at the irs leaked confidential tax documents to the progressive leaning journalism group propublica an action which the irs official manual says can result in up to five years in prison and fines of up to 5 000  who are the two rogue individuals disgraced former irs commissioner stevens said went off the reservation and acted overly aggressive and what if any connections do they have politically if as the inspector general report alleges political motivations were not driving the targeting of conservatives then what was also what discipline did the two rogue agents receive  did irs agents coordinate with sen carl levin d mi or his staff to go after them conservative groups as he told the new york times following levin s letters to then irs commissioner doug shulman and director lois lerner  did sen max baucus d mo or his staff communicate or coordinate with irs agents after baucus wrote this september 28 2010 letter instructing then commissioner douglas shulman to have his agency survey major 401 c 4 c 5 and c 6 organizations to determine whether they are acting as conduits for major donors advancing their own private interests

code by political groups focused on federal election activities sen charles schumer d ny sen michael bennet d co sen sheldon whitehouse d ri sen jeff merkley d or sen tom udall d nm sen jeanne shaheen d nh and sen al franken d mn  what communications existed between obama reelection campaign co chair joe solomonese whom the national organization for marriage nom alleges received its confidential tax returns and irs agents  what portion of obama s 79 increase in audits of charities were of conservative groups  if political motivations were not driving the selective targeting of 500 conservative organizations then why were a similar number of liberal groups not harassed  what role did irs rulings and agreements division director holly paz who in 2008 donated 2 000 to obama play in ratcheting up irs investigations as she promised she would in june 2012 whether reporters will ask and obama will answer the critical questions that must be resolved remains to be seen outrage intensified in washington on monday over the disclosure that the internal revenue service targeted conservative groups for special scrutiny when they applied for tax exempt status president barack obama at a white house appearance with the british prime minister said that he wanted all the facts but used strong terms to condemn the reported conduct  i ve got no patience with it i will not tolerate it he said  and we will make sure that we find out exactly what happened on this the treasury department s inspector general for tax administration will release an audit report later this week in the meantime here are five big unanswered questions looming over the irs how did this start and why in january 2010 a supreme court decision known as citizens united touched off a flood of political spending much of it classified under a section of tax law known as 501 c 4 that entitles certain social welfare groups to tax exemption two months later a special unit of the irs in cincinnati assigned to screen applications for 501 c 4 status began searching for groups with descriptions that included tea party and patriots according to a partial draft of the inspector general s report obtained by nbc news lois lerner head of the irs division on tax exempt organizations said friday that the targeting of conservative groups was inappropriate but absolutely not influenced by the white house she also said that none of the targeted groups was denied tax exempt status what has not been spelled out is who in the cincinnati office decided to search for conservative groups and why at least one tea party group called on the administration monday to appoint a special prosecutor to look into the matter which it called un american and nixonesque one of the articles of impeachment against president richard nixon accused him of targeting political opponents for tax audits both republicans and democrats in congress are determined to investigate  i just don t buy that this was a couple of rogue irs employees sen susan collins r maine said sunday on the cnn program state of the union who knew what and when higher in the irs lerner learned in june 2011 that agents had targeted groups with names including tea party and patriots according to the draft obtained by nbc news she instructed that the criteria immediately be revised according to the draft ten months later in march 2012 the irs commissioner at the time douglas shulman testified to congress that the irs was not targeting tax exempt groups based on their politics the irs said over the weekend that senior executives were not aware of the targeting but it remains unclear who knew what and when shulman who left the agency last fall has not spoken publicly about the scandal and did not answer a request for comment monday from nbc news members of congress had sent letters to shulman as early as june 2011 asking specifically about targeting of conservative groups according to a house ways and means committee summary obtained by nbc news the irs responded at least six times but made no mention of targeting conservatives according to the committee s summary will anyone be fired sen marco rubio r fla on monday demanded the resignation of the head of the irs that is steven miller who is serving as acting commissioner until obama nominates a replacement the last commissioner was shulman who was appointed by president george w bush in 2008 left the agency in november and has taken a position as a guest scholar at the brookings institution newt gingrich the republican former house speaker told msnbc on monday that obama should say he s going to fire everybody he can legally fire who s been involved with this how will the white house contain the political damage the irs scandal presents a daunting political challenge for the white house which is already being forced to defend its handling of the deadly attack on a u s diplomatic post in benghazi libya last september the furor over the irs has come from both parties sen max baucus of montana the democratic chairman of the senate finance committee said monday the agency had committed an outrageous abuse of power and pledged a grilling  the irs will now be the ones put under additional scrutiny he said sen tim kaine of virginia called it inexcusable and sen joe manchin of west virginia said the president must immediately condemn this attack on our values and find those individuals in his administration who are responsible and fire them how can this be prevented in the future rubio in his letter calling for the resignation of the irs chief called the behavior seemingly unconstitutional and potentially criminal but under existing law the worst that can happen to an irs agent who discriminates against taxpayers is getting fired said rep mike turner an ohio republican who sits on the house oversight committee turner introduced a bill monday to increase the toughest penalty to five years in prison and a 5 000 fine  this is about protecting the rights of all americans and their ability to freely express their political thoughts he said kelly o donnell of nbc news contributed to this report reuters and the associated press also contributed this story was originally published onwhat s worse for the obama white house for the controversies to be full scale scandals that go all the way to the top or for them to be the result of bureaucratic incompetence the latest irs developments on obama s morehouse speech two unions now oppose the senate immigration bill getting the hillary 08 band back together or not and virginia meet e w jackson  scandal or bureaucratic incompetency here s a question for the obama white house to ponder what s worse for all the controversies especially the irs targeting conservative sounding groups to be a full fledged scandal that goes all the way to the top or for them to be the result of bureaucratic incompetence you could make an argument that the latter outcome could be just as damaging to the president because it raises doubts about his competency and the public s trust in government as time s joe klein wrote last week it can and will be argued that the president is to blame for lousy management some in the administration are saying that civil service rules prevent obama from firing the midlevel bozos but what about the higher ups why haven t the democrats proposed a full scale review of civil service laws such laws certainly hinder effective governance which the democrats are supposedly selling of course there are plenty of examples where you can argue that government has worked think of the rebuilding after hurricane sandy or the response to the boston bombings but government working in a crisis vs government working every day are two different issues and it s never a good story when a white house has to respond to examples when the government isn t working for the american people  competency questions pile up after all the democrats are the party of government and obama got elected in part by pushing competency at least compared with the previous administration the white house should hope its problems are political in nature because that s something they ve proven adept at dealing with but the competency questions for this administration are piling up the veteran s administration is a mess their explanation on benghazi is about the lack of communication and security procedures and the irs explanation is overworked and mistake prone bureaucrats in cincinnati right now the white house is benefitting from those congressional republicans who are desperately searching for scandal what the white house should fear more is if republicans use their government is too big argument to go to core of competency  the latest irs developments it s worth noting that today s news about the white house counsel being informed of the irs audit was first confirmed at a jay carney press briefing last week a senior administration also confirms to nbc news that white house counsel kathy ruemmler did not inform the president what s not clear is if she gave a heads up to the rest of the senior staff and what s also not clear is how much detail ruemmler was offered about the audit itself meanwhile the sunday new york times offered a lengthy piece tracing what went wrong in that cincinnati irs office  while there are still many gaps in the story of how the i r s scandal happened interviews with current and former employees and with lawyers who dealt with them along with a review of i r s documents paint a more muddled picture of an understaffed cincinnati outpost that was alienated from the broader i r s culture and given little direction overseen by a revolving cast of midlevel managers stalled by miscommunication with i r s lawyers and executives in washington and confused about the rules they were enforcing the cincinnati specialists flagged virtually every application with tea party in its name but their review went beyond conservative groups more than 400 organizations came under scrutiny including at least two dozen liberal leaning ones and some that were seemingly apolitical obama s morehouse speech also on sunday president obama delivered a very personal commencement address at morehouse college in atlanta ga keep setting an example for what it means to be a man he told the graduates at the historically black college  be the best husband to your wife or you re your boyfriend or your partner be the best father you can be to your children because nothing is more important the president added i was raised by a heroic single mom wonderful grandparents made incredible sacrifices for me but i sure wish i had had a father who was not only present but involved didn t know my dad and so my whole life i ve tried to be for michelle and my girls what my father was not for my mother and me i want to break that cycle where a father is not at home where a father is not helping to raise that son or daughter  i want to be a better father a better husband a better man and pair obama s commencement address with the one his wife delivered on friday at another historically black college bowie state instead of dreaming of being a teacher or a lawyer or a business leader they re fantasizing about being a baller or a rapper please reject the slander that says a black child with a book is trying to act white two unions now oppose senate immigration legislation on the topic of immigration the national citizenship and immigration services council a union representing 12 000 u s citizenship and immigration services officers will publicly oppose the senate gang of eight immigration plan monday giving critics of the overhaul effort additional political ammunition as they work to defeat legislation working its way through the senate judiciary committee nbc s carrie dann reports the reason for the opposition the union believes the legislation would fail to address an insurmountable bureaucracy at the federal agency overseeing immigration documents dann adds that this union joins the national immigration and customs enforcement council in its opposition to the gang of eight measure  getting the band back together or not it should be hardly surprising that folks like howard wolfson patti solis doyle and mark penn would not work on a hillary clinton presidential campaign if she decides to run in 2016 as the washington post reports after all none of these people went on to join her at the state department like other trusted hillary inc aides did what s more solis doyle was sacked as campaign manager after clinton lost iowa if clinton runs it would likely be a combination of trusted former aides as well as some new blood that s often true for plenty of repeat presidential candidates yet there s another way to look at this washington post piece it s a message to many outside of hillary world especially those who were critical of the 08 hillary campaign that the whole band won t be getting back together if she runs in 16 and those folks might see this as a positive development  meet e w jackson virginia

washington ap senate minority leader mitch mcconnell who accused the obama administration of nixon style dirty tricks last year said friday that the internal revenue service s targeting of conservative groups is part of a broader government assault on free speech mcconnell r ky seized on the spate of controversies besetting the white house saying americans are recognizing a pattern of attack on first amendment rights across government agencies the administration president obama s congressional allies left wing groups and public employee unions  as serious as the irs scandal is what we re dealing with here is larger than the actions of one agency or any group of employees mcconnell who is up for re election next year said in a speech to the conservative american enterprise institute  this administration has institutionalized the practice of pitting bureaucrats against the very people they re supposed to be serving and it needs to stop speaking to the same organization last year mcconnell accused the administration and obama s re election campaign of leaking tax information and maintaining an enemies list in a chilling style reminiscent of president richard nixon the republican who resigned in 1974 amid the watergate scandal in the first six months of obama s second term the administration s problems have produced an assortment of political targets for republicans one is the irs affair which has resulted in resignations and departures from the agency no evidence has come to light that anyone in the obama administration outside the irs was involved in targeting conservative groups for extra scrutiny when they applied for tax exempt status other issues facing the obama administration this year include government surveillance of phone and internet records its handling of last year s terrorist attack on the u s diplomatic mission in benghazi libya which killed four americans the justice department s seizure of phone records of journalists at the associated press and in another case reading the e mails of fox news reporter james rosen mcconnell referred to the irs episode with a bit of i told you so  when i warned about all this last year i got slammed by the usual suspects on the left they said i was full of it he said  but even some of them now seem to realize that just because mcconnell is the one pulling the alarm doesn t mean there isn t a fire the irs scandal has reminded people of the temptations to abuse that big government and its political patrons are prone to people are waking up to a pattern here in comments certain to appeal to republican voters mcconnell described public sector unions as power hungry and able to expand their reach with the help of congressional friends he said the unions no longer serve the public s interest but rather the government s  there s no better illustration of this than the announcement this week that in the midst of congressional hearings into their activities unionized employees at the irs are about to get 70 million in bonuses mcconnell said sen chuck grassley r iowa said this week that the irs plans to hand out 70 million in bonuses to employees under a contract with the employees union irs workers can receive individual performance bonuses of up to 3 500 a year in response to grassley s criticism the agency said it s under a legal obligation to comply with its collective bargaining agreement with the national treasury employees union the agency and the union say they are in negotiations over the matter mcconnell used the speech to deliver a forceful defense of the supreme court s 2010 citizens united ruling which lifted many restrictions on corporate spending in political elections in this image made from video released by wikileaks on friday oct 11 2013

videos released by the organization wikileaks the award ceremony was attended by three previous recipients  ap photo moscow ap former national security agency systems analyst edward snowden says surveillance programs used by the united states to tap into phone and internet connections around the world are making people less safe in short video clips posted by the wikileaks website on friday snowden said the nsa mass surveillance he revealed before fleeing to russia puts us at risk of coming into conflict with our own government snowden who faces espionage charges in the u s over the leak described the techniques as dragnet mass surveillance that puts entire populations under sort of an eye that sees everything even when it s not needed  they hurt our economy they hurt our country they limit our ability to speak and think and live and be creative to have relationships and to associate freely snowden said the videos are the first of snowden speaking since july 12 when he was shown at a moscow airport pleading with russian authorities to grant him asylum which they did on aug 1 that decision has strained the relations between the u s and russia president barack obama called off a meeting with president vladimir putin at a summit hosted by russia in september snowden said the u s government was unwilling to prosecute high officials who lied to congress and the country on camera but they ll stop at nothing to persecute someone who told them the truth in a note accompanying the videos wikileaks said snowden spoke on wednesday in moscow as he accepted the sam adams award given annually by a group of retired u s national security officers and named for a cia analyst during the vietnam war who accused the u s military of deliberately underestimating the enemy s strength for political purposes four former u s government officials who were at the ceremony told the associated press on thursday that snowden is adjusting to life in russia and said they saw no evidence that he was under the control of local security services they refused to say where they met with snowden or where he is living president barack obama has apologised to the california attorney general for remarking on her appearance at a fundraising event on thursday mr obama described kamala harris a long time friend as the best looking attorney general in the country ms harris s spokesman said she strongly supported mr obama but would not say whether she had accepted his apology critics have cited the remark as an example of the ongoing hurdles women face in the workplace speaking after ms harris at the fundraising event in california on thursday mr obama said she was brilliant and she is dedicated and she is tough and she is exactly what you d want in anybody who is administering the law and making sure that everybody is getting a fair shake then he added she also happens to be by far the best looking attorney general in the country it s true come on and she is a great friend and has just been a great supporter for many many years on friday the white house said the president had spoken to the attorney general to apologise for the distraction created by his comments  he did not want in any way to diminish the attorney general s professional accomplishments and her capabilities press secretary jay carney said he added that the president fully recognises the challenge women continue to face in the workplace and that they should not be judged based on appearance writers and bloggers have commented that although the president is a personal friend of ms harris and a strong supporter of women s rights his remarks were inappropriate president barack obama has commuted the sentences of eight americans who would have had shorter prison terms under current drug sentencing laws each of the six men and two women had served more than 15 years in prison for charges related to crack cocaine a 2010 law reduced the disparity in sentencing between crack and powdered cocaine offences and in august the administration dropped mandatory minimum sentences for non violent drug offenders critics say that heavy drug sentences have hit minorities hardest in a statement mr obama said the 2010 law the fair sentencing act had begun to right a decades old injustice but for thousands of inmates it came too late  instead because of a disparity in the law that is now recognised as unjust they remain in prison separated from their families and their communities at a cost of millions of taxpayer dollars each year some 47 of us prison inmates have been incarcerated for drug offences according to the federal bureau of prisons many of those with newly commuted sentences were young when they received lengthy prison terms six of those on the commutation list had been sentenced to life in prison most will be released in april one man will go free immediately and another will be released in 2018 among those ending their prison terms reynolds wintersmith a first time

new key information in the 2008 version of aaron s bid for clemency to the white house before this mr obama had commuted only one sentence in the five years of his presidency also involving another drug case and had pardoned 39 people on thursday the president also pardoned 13 others for various crimes all had already served their full prison terms a pardon forgives a crime and wipes out the conviction while a commutation leaves the conviction but ends the punishment in august us attorney general eric holder announced a major shift in federal sentencing policies targeting long mandatory terms that he said have flooded the nation s prisons with low level drug offenders and diverted crime fighting dollars that could be far better spent and a bill in congress would apply the fair sentencing act to some drug offenders already in prison allowing potential clemency to a group of people estimated to be in the thousands by advocacy groups perhaps we can help you find what you

use the process of writing regulations is underway and it will become harder to rescind the legislation peter bensinger who ran the dea under presidents gerald ford jimmy carter and ronald reagan told the bbc he added the obama administration should sue colorado and washington state as it recently had the state of arizona over an immigration measure it deemed clashed with federal law mr bensinger warned that full implementation of the legalisation laws would cause havoc in the communities schools and roads of colorado and washington state  the highways would be littered with fatalities because you re going to have increased use and marijuana stays in the body much longer than alcohol mr bensinger said but sanho tree a drug policy analyst who supports legalisation said the former dea chiefs warnings were scare tactics their letter is an attempt to goad the obama administration into a show down with the states in the supreme court said mr tree director of the drug policy project at the institute for policy studies  most of these drug policy statements are about turf which is really about budgets said mr tree he said drug enforcement agencies were attempting to maintain a monopoly on doctrine he said the federal government must be realistic about changing attitudes towards the drug and he said that in states with medical marijuana laws in place critics worst fears had not come to pass local governments in california s have legal authority to ban storefront pot shops within their borders california s highest court ruled on monday in an opinion likely to further diminish the state s once robust medical marijuana industry nearly 17 years after voters in the state legalized medical marijuana the court ruled unanimously in a legal challenge to a ban the city of riverside enacted in 2010 the advocacy group americans for safe access estimates that another 200 jurisdictions statewide have similar prohibitions on retail pot sales many were enacted after the number of retail medical marijuana outlets boomed in southern california after a 2009 memo from the u s justice department said prosecuting pot sales would be a low priority however the rush to outlaw pot shops has slowed in the 21 months since the four federal prosecutors in california launched a coordinated crackdown on dispensaries by threatening to seize the property of landlords who lease space to the shops hundreds of dispensary operators have since been evicted or closed voluntarily marijuana advocates have argued that allowing local government to bar dispensaries thwarts the intent of the state s medical marijuana law the nation s first to make the drug accessible to residents with doctor s recommendations to use it the ruling came in the case filed after riverside city lawmakers used zoning powers to declare storefront pot shops as public nuisances and ban the operations in 2010 the inland empire patient s health and wellness center part of the explosion of retail medical marijuana outlets sued to stop the city from shutting it down a number of counties and cities were awaiting the supreme court ruling before moving forward with bans of their own a mid level appeals court previously sided with the city of riverside but other courts have come to opposite conclusions last summer a trial judge ruled that riverside county could not close medical marijuana dispensaries in unincorporated areas because the move did not give the shops any room to operate legally under state law meanwhile an appeals court in southern california struck down los angeles county s 2 year old ban on dispensaries ruling state law allows cooperatives and collectives to grow store and distribute pot perhaps we can help you find what you wanted when you hit this error page try our site map for

or send us a question or comment in 2010 congress passed the fair sentencing act which reduced the vast disparity in the way the federal courts punish crack versus powder cocaine offenses instead of treating 100 grams of cocaine the same as 1 gram of crack for sentencing purposes the law cut the ratio to 18 to 1 initially the law applied only to future offenders but a year later the united states sentencing commission voted to apply it retroactively republicans raged charging that crime would go up and that prisoners would overwhelm the courts with frivolous demands for sentence reductions senator charles grassley of iowa said the commission was pursuing a liberal agenda at all costs this week we began to learn that there are no costs only benefits according to a preliminary report released by the commission more than 7 300 federal prisoners have had their sentences shortened under the law the average reduction is 29 months meaning that over all offenders are serving roughly 16 000 years fewer than they otherwise would have and since the federal government spends about 30 000 per year to house an inmate this reduction alone is worth nearly half a billion dollars big money for a bureau of prisons with a 7 billion budget in addition the commission found no significant difference in recidivism rates between those prisoners who were released early and those who served their full sentences federal judges nationwide have long expressed vigorous disagreement with both the sentencing disparity and the mandatory minimum sentences they are forced to impose both of which have been drivers of our bloated federal prison system but two bipartisan bills in congress now propose a cheaper and more humane approach it would include reducing mandatory minimums giving judges more flexibility to sentence below those minimums and making more inmates eligible for reductions to their sentences under the new ratio but 18 to 1 is still out of whack the ratio was always based on faulty science and misguided assumptions and it still disproportionately punishes blacks who make up more than 80 percent of those prosecuted for federal crack offenses the commission and the obama administration have called for a 1 to 1 ratio the question is not whether we can afford to do it but whether we can afford not to washington president obama expanding his push to curtail severe

crusade to legalize marijuana to san francisco on monday joining pot advocates to urge the united states and his own country to decriminalize the sale and recreational use of cannabis fox met for three hours with the advocates including steve deangelo the oakland based executive director of california s largest marijuana dispensary and former microsoft executive jamen shively who hopes to create a seattle based pot brand now that washington state has legalized recreational use legalization fox told reporters after the meeting is the only way to end the violence of mexican drug cartels which he blamed on america s war on drugs  the cost of the war is becoming unbearable too high for mexico for latin america and for the rest of the world fox said in english every day he said 40 young people are killed in drug related violence fox s position on legalizing drugs has evolved over time since the days when he cooperated with u s efforts to tamp down production in mexico during his 2000 2006 presidential term he has been increasingly vocal in his opposition to current policies backing two prior efforts to legalize marijuana in mexico mexico s current president enrique peña nieto has opposed legalization but he recently said that he would consider world opinion on the matter particularly in light of recent voter approved initiatives to legalize marijuana in washington state and colorado for recreational use in san francisco on monday fox said he had signed on to attend and help develop an international summit later this month in mexico to strategize a path to end marijuana prohibition participants scheduled to attend the three day meeting starting july 18 in san cristobal include an american surgeon the dean of harvard s school of public health and a mexican congressman who plans to introduce a bill to legalize marijuana in mexico this summer fox said the bill which he expects to be introduced by mexican lawmaker fernando belaunzaran would legalize adult recreational use of marijuana fox said support for legalizing marijuana in the united states has been growing nineteen states and the district of columbia have passed medical marijuana laws according to the pro legalization national organization for the reform of marijuana laws but the drug remains illegal under federal law lifting the prohibition on cannabis in mexico however appears to face more of an uphill battle mexican lawmakers have rejected previous legalization efforts and polls have shown little popular support for the idea but fox promised to wage what he said was a necessary battle  we cannot afford more blood and the loss of more young people fox said  we must get out of the trap we are in reuters retired rhode island congressman patrick kennedy is taking aim at what he sees as knee jerk support for marijuana legalization among his fellow liberals in a project that carries special meaning for the self confessed former oxycontin addict kennedy 45 a democrat and younger son of the late lion of the senate edward m kennedy of massachusetts is leading a group called project sam smart approaches to marijuana that opposes legalization and seeks to rise above america s culture war over pot with its images of long haired hippies battling law and order conservatives project proposals include increased funding for mental health courts and treatment of drug dependency so those caught using marijuana might avoid incarceration get help and potentially have their criminal records cleared kennedy wants cancer patients and others with serious illnesses to be able to obtain drugs with cannabinoids but in a more regulated way that could involve the u s food and drug administration playing a larger role the eight term former congressman from rhode island and the group he chairs will put forth their plan on wednesday with a media appearance in denver their efforts follow the november election that saw voters in washington state and colorado become the first in the nation to approve measures to tax and regulate pot sales for recreational use kennedy s group is seeking to shift the debate and reclaim momentum for the anti legalization movement in part by proposing new solutions with appeal to liberals such as taking a public health approach to combat marijuana use legalization backers have argued that the so called war on drugs launched in 1971 by former president richard nixon has failed to stem marijuana use and has instead saddled otherwise law abiding pot smokers with criminal records that may block their avenues to landing a successful job kennedy faults the u s government for allocating too much of its 25 billion drug control budget to law enforcement rather than to treatment and prevention  yes the drug war has been a failure but let s look at the science and let s look at what works and let s not just throw out the baby with the bathwater kennedy who served in the u s house of representatives from 1995 to 2011 said in a telephone interview the u s department of justice is still developing a policy in regard to the new state legalization measures president barack obama said in an interview with abc news last month that it did not make sense for the federal government to focus on recreational drug users in a state that has already said that under state law that s legal conservative political commentator david frum a speech writer for former president george w bush is also a board member on project sam which lends it a bipartisan flavor for his part kennedy is aiming many of his arguments toward liberals like himself polls show democrats largely favoring legalizing marijuana and among the 18 states that allow medical marijuana several are in the west and northeast and are heavily democratic  the fact is people are afraid on the political left to look like they re not for an alternative to incarceration and criminalization and they re afraid they re not going to look sympathetic to a cancer patient who might use marijuana kennedy said as a result he said the legalization position mistakenly comes to be seen as glamorous kennedy admits to having smoked pot but also said that as an asthma sufferer he found other ways to get high in 2006 he crashed his car into a security barrier in washington d c and soon after sought treatment for drug dependency he said he was addicted to the pain reliever oxycontin at that time and suffered from alcoholism he added that he has been continuously sober for nearly two years kennedy who was married for the first time in 2011 said he worries his 8 month old son might be predisposed to drug abuse due to a kind of genetic trigger and that is part of his fight against legalization he also said he wants to reduce the environmental factors that pull that trigger such as marijuana use being commonly accepted meanwhile another prominent figure from rhode island the newly crowned miss universe olivia culpo is making waves by also objecting to legalization she told fox news this week there are too many bad habits that go with the drug in washington state alison holcomb was campaign director for the legalization measure which billed itself as having a public health element to help people dependent on marijuana the measure which is not set to go into full effect until after state regulators spend most of 2013 setting guidelines would allow adults 21 and older to buy marijuana at special stores holcomb argued that drug dependency courts are more geared toward users of hardcore drugs and that the approach her group put forward is the sensible one  i don t know what a public health approach without legalization looks like if you re still arresting people she said taxes on marijuana sales would generate at the high end of estimates over 500 million a year with 67 million of that going to a state agency that provides drug treatment said mark cooke policy adviser for the american civil liberties union of washington state which supported the campaign also included in the tax revenue would be 44 million for education and public health campaigns including a phone line for people wanting to quit using marijuana cooke said
